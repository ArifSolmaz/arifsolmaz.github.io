My research interests lie at the intersection of **exoplanets, stellar activity, and time-series analysis**, with strong emphasis on data analysis and scientific computing.

## Main Research Topics

### 1. Transiting Exoplanets Around Active Stars

- Transit light curve analysis for systems with strong **starspot activity**  
  (e.g. WASP-52, HAT-P-36, HAT-P-11, HATS-2).
- Modelling **occulted and unocculted starspots** and their impact on
  measured planetary parameters.
- Investigating how stellar activity affects **transit timing variations (TTVs)**,
  transmission spectra, and inferred atmospheric properties.

### 2. Transmission Spectroscopy and Atmospheric Retrieval

- Analysis of space-based data (TESS, HST, JWST, CHEOPS when available).
- Studying how starspots and faculae can mimic or bias detections of molecules
  (e.g. TiO, silicate clouds) in exoplanet atmospheres.
- Building pipelines for **reproducible light-curve and spectrum analysis**.

### 3. Time-Series Analysis and Machine Learning

- Period searches, detrending, and noise modelling for space-based photometry.
- Exploring applications of **machine learning** for variable star and exoplanet light curves.
- Open-source tools for teaching and research (TESS/JWST analysis notebooks, Streamlit apps, etc.).

## Ongoing / Planned Projects

- Development of a **starspot-aware transit modelling framework** (Python/Streamlit).
- Projects for undergraduate students on:
  - TESS light curve analysis,
  - Simple exoplanet detection and characterisation,
  - Robotics–astronomy crossover topics (e.g. telescope control, simulations).
