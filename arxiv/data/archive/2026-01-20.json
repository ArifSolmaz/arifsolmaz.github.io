      "title": "Detection of four cold Jupiters through combined analyses of radial velocity and astrometry data",
      "abstract": "Cold Jupiters play a crucial role in planet formation and dynamical evolution. Since their initial discovery around 47 UMa, they have attracted significant interest, yet their formation mechanisms remain uncertain, underscoring the need to expand the known population. In this work, we combine RV data with Gaia astrometry using Hipparcos-Gaia proper-motion anomalies over a 25-year baseline. By jointly modeling both datasets with the MCMC framework, we constrain planetary masses, orbital inclinations, and three-dimensional orbital architectures. This reduces RV degeneracies and improves mass determinations. Four cold Jupiters are reported: HD 68475 b and HD 100508 b are each the first confirmed planet in their systems, with orbital periods $7832_{-323}^{+463}$ d and $5681\\pm42$ d and dynamical masses of $5.16_{-0.47}^{+0.53} M_{\\text{Jup}}$ and $1.2_{-0.18}^{+0.30} M_{\\text{Jup}}$, respectively. In multi-planet systems, HD 48265 c has a period of $10418_{-1400}^{+2400}$ d and a mass of $3.71_{-0.43}^{+0.68} M_{\\text{Jup}}$, while HD 114386 c orbits at $444.00_{-0.88}^{+0.93}$ d with a minimum mass of $0.37 \\pm 0.03 M_{\\text{Jup}}$. The two planets in the HD 48265 system may exhibit a significant mutual inclination, making it a target for testing the von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov mechanism. HD 68475 b is a promising candidate for future direct imaging with ELT/METIS. We identified a Jupiter analog with the longest known orbital period among planets with masses between 0.5 and 2 $M_{\\text{Jup}}$, implying that a substantial population of cold Jupiters likely awaits discovery by Gaia. This study expands the sample of cold Jupiters with constrained orbits and dynamical masses, demonstrating the value of combining radial velocity and astrometry in exoplanet research.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nImagine trying to understand how our solar system formed by only studying Earth and Mars—you'd miss the crucial role that Jupiter played in shaping everything around it. That's exactly the challenge astronomers face when studying distant planetary systems. Jupiter-like planets that orbit far from their stars, called \"cold Jupiters,\" are cosmic architects that influence how entire planetary systems develop. Yet these distant giants are notoriously difficult to spot and study. This research tackles that challenge head-on, uncovering four new cold Jupiters and demonstrating a powerful new method for finding many more. Understanding these distant worlds helps us piece together the story of how planetary systems—including our own—came to be.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers combined two detective techniques to hunt for these elusive planets. First, they used radial velocity measurements, which detect the tiny wobble a planet causes as it tugs on its host star—like watching a dog walker get pulled back and forth by an invisible leash. Second, they incorporated data from the Gaia space telescope, which precisely tracks how stars move across the sky over decades. When a star has a hidden planetary companion, its motion becomes slightly erratic, like a person walking while carrying an invisible, shifting weight. By combining these two approaches over a 25-year period, the team could determine not just that planets exist, but their exact masses, orbital tilts, and three-dimensional paths through space.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe team discovered four cold Jupiters, each taking years to decades to complete a single orbit around their stars. The most extreme, dubbed HD 68475 b, takes over 21 years to circle its star and weighs about five times more than Jupiter. Another standout is HD 100508 b, which completes its 15-year orbit while weighing slightly more than Jupiter. Two others were found in multi-planet systems, including one that may be tilted dramatically compared to its planetary neighbor—a configuration that could reveal how planetary systems can become dynamically unstable over time. Remarkably, one of these worlds holds the record for the longest orbital period among planets in its mass range.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThis research opens a new chapter in exoplanet discovery. The success of combining stellar wobbles with precise positional measurements suggests that thousands more cold Jupiters are waiting to be found in existing Gaia data. Some of these newly discovered worlds, particularly HD 68475 b, are prime candidates for direct imaging with next-generation telescopes, potentially allowing astronomers to study their atmospheres and compositions directly.

      "abstract": "Although the migration of hot Jupiters is not yet fully understood, measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle λ help shed light on the processes involved. Here we present Doppler tomography of three known hot Jupiters to determine their λ orientation: HAT-P-49 b, HAT-P-57A b, and XO-3A b. Our analysis explores the impact of cross-correlation processing methods on the detectability and characterization of the planet's Doppler shadow using up to three independent routines for cross-correlation functions extraction; those being: Yabi, iSpec and IRAF. After accounting for differences among the results obtained with the various routines, we report: first, the HAT-P-49 system is a case of a hot Jupiter on a polar orbit with λ=-85.3{\\pm}1.7°, second, HAT-P-57A indicates practically no deviation of the planet's projected orbit from the host's equatorial plane with λ=-0.4^{+1.4}_{-1.9}°, and third, the XO-3A system with the measured value of λ=38{+3}_{-4}° lies in between an aligned and a perpendicular orientation, which is a less populated region of the spin-orbit distribution. Our findings highlight both the diversity of spin-orbit angles among close-in giant planets and the potential discrepancies in their measurement that can arise from different approaches to constructing the cross-correlation functions.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nImagine throwing a baseball perfectly straight while spinning like a top—that's how we'd expect planets to orbit their stars, moving in the same direction as the star's rotation. But the universe loves to surprise us. Scientists have discovered that many \"hot Jupiters\"—massive planets that orbit incredibly close to their stars—move in bizarre ways: some travel backward, others loop around their star's poles like a Ferris wheel. These strange orbits hold crucial clues about how planetary systems form and evolve, helping us understand whether our own solar system's neat, orderly arrangement is common or remarkably special.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers used a clever technique called Doppler tomography to study three hot Jupiter planets. When a planet passes in front of its star (like a tiny eclipse), it blocks different parts of the star's spinning surface. Since one side of a spinning star moves toward us and the other moves away, this creates a distinctive signature in the star's light—like a shadow moving across the star's face. By carefully analyzing this shadow using three different computer programs and a sensitive instrument called HARPS-N, the scientists could determine exactly how each planet's orbit is tilted compared to its star's rotation. Think of it like figuring out whether a marble rolling around a spinning basketball follows the equator, goes over the poles, or takes some other crazy path.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe three planets showed dramatically different behaviors. HAT-P-57A b is the \"well-behaved\" one, orbiting almost perfectly aligned with its star's equator. XO-3A b is moderately tilted at 38 degrees—imagine a planet taking a diagonal path around its star. Most remarkably, HAT-P-49 b is nearly polar, orbiting at 85 degrees—essentially going over its star's north and south poles rather than around its equator. This polar orbit is like a planet doing loop-the-loops instead of following a normal circular track.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThese findings add to growing evidence that planetary systems can be far more chaotic than our own solar system suggests. Understanding why some hot Jupiters end up in such extreme orbits helps scientists piece together the violent early histories of planetary systems—including whether planets migrate inward through gentle gravitational interactions or dramatic collisions and ejections. This research brings us closer to answering fundamental questions about how common Earth-like, stable planetary systems truly are in our galaxy.",

      "title": "Metal Pipe: A Broadly-Applicable Stellar Abundance Pipeline Using Isochronal Parameters",
      "abstract": "Characterizing exoplanet host stars at a population level requires a method of homogeneously characterizing stellar properties across all spectral types. To this end, we have developed Metal Pipe, a new code for determining stellar parameters and abundances, which is designed for use across a wider range of spectral types than many commonly used codes. It combines the widely-used package MOOG with photometric stellar parameters, a user-supplied high-resolution spectrum, and a newly curated list of spectral lines. Metal Pipe outputs values for $T_{\\rm{eff}}$, $\\log{(g)}$, $M_*$, $R_*$, and $L_*$ from isochrones, and abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe from MOOG. In this paper, we describe the Metal Pipe algorithm and tests of Metal Pipe against previous abundance measurements on archival HIRES spectra of 503 F, G, and K type stars. We find RMS scatters of ~100 K in $T_{\\rm{eff}}$, ~0.10 dex in $\\log{(g)}$, and ~0.10 dex for all measured abundances. These values are comparable to estimated measurement uncertainties, verifying Metal Pipe for continued use in building a detailed abundance catalog. Future papers in this series will test Metal Pipe's applicability to late K and M dwarf stars, and provide other improvements.",
