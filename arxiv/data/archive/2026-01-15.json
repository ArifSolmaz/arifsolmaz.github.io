      "abstract": "The discovery of a biosphere on another planet would transform how we view ourselves, and our planet Earth, in relation to the rest of the cosmos. We now know Earth is one planet among eight circling our sun; our sun is part of a swirling galaxy of over one hundred billion other suns; and our galaxy is one of untold billions in the universe. While we do not yet know how many, if any, other biospheres exist on the countless worlds orbiting countless other suns, we stand at the precipice of a new era of discovery, enabled by powerful new facilities able to peer across the light years into the atmospheres of planets similar to our own.

      "abstract": "Understanding the demographics of close-in planets is crucial for insights into exoplanet formation and evolution. We present a detailed analysis of occurrence rates for close-in (0.5-16 day) planets with radii between 2 and 20$\\,R_{\\oplus}$ around FGK main-sequence stars. Our study uses a comprehensive sample from four years of TESS Science Processing Operations Center full-frame image data cross-matched with Gaia, analysed through our rigorous detection, vetting, and validation pipeline. Using high-confidence planet candidates, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian model to determine occurrence rates in the two-dimensional orbital period-radius plane. Our results are presented using 10-by-10 bins across the period-radius parameter space, offering unprecedented resolution and statistical precision. We find an overall occurrence rate of $9.4^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\\%$. When using identical binning, our occurrence rate posteriors distributions align with Kepler's but have a magnitude smaller uncertainties on average. For hot Jupiters, we estimate the overall occurrence rate of $0.39^{+0.03}_{-0.02}\\%$. This value is consistent with the previous Kepler FGK-type result within $1σ$. We find an overall occurrence rate of Neptunian desert planets of $0.08\\pm0.01\\%$, to our knowledge the first such determination. Additionally, in a volume-limited Gaia subsample within 100 pc in the same parameter region, we measure an overall planet occurrence rate of $15.4^{+1.6}_{-1.5}\\%$ and a hot Jupiter occurrence rate of $0.42^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\\%$. Our results establishes an improved foundation for constraining theoretical models of exoplanet populations.",

      "title": "Mass estimates of the young TOI-451 transiting planets: Multidimensional Gaussian Process on stellar spectroscopic and photometric signals",
      "abstract": "The young TOI-451 planetary system, aged 125 Myr, provides a unique opportunity to test theories of planetary internal structures and atmospheric mass loss through examination of its three transiting planets. We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to determine the orbital and physical properties of the system. We perform multidimensional Gaussian Process regression with the code pyaneti on spectroscopic time-series and NGTS/LCO light curves to disentangle the stellar and planetary signal in ESPRESSO radial velocities. We show how contemporaneous photometry serves as an activity indicator to inform RV modelling within a multidimensional Gaussian Processes framework. We argue that this can be exploited when spectroscopic observations are adversely affected by low signal-to-noise and/or poor sampling. We estimate the Doppler semi-amplitudes of Kb = 2.6(+1.1,-1.2) m/s, Kc = 1.2(+1.0,-0.8) m/s and Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.2 m/s. This translates into 2-sigma mass estimates for TOI-451 b and d of Mb = 4.7(+2.1,-2.2) Earth masses and Md = 10.2(+4.6,-4.5) Earth masses, as well as a mass upper limit for TOI-451 c of Mc < 11.5 Earth masses. The derived planetary properties suggest that planets c and d contain significant hydrogen-rich envelopes. The inferred parameters of TOI-451 b are consistent with either a rocky world that still retains a small hydrogen envelope or a water world. These insights make the TOI-451 system an ideal laboratory for future follow-up studies aimed at measuring atmospheric compositions, detecting atmospheric mass-loss signatures, and further exploring planetary formation and evolution processes.",

      "abstract": "Topographic models are essential for characterizing planetary surfaces and for inferring underlying geological processes. Nevertheless, meter-scale topographic data remain limited, which constrains detailed planetary investigations, even for the Moon, where extensive high-resolution orbital images are available. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution.",

Most impressively, it outperformed existing single-image reconstruction techniques while being much faster and more flexible than conventional methods.\n<h4>Looking Forward</h4>\nThis breakthrough could revolutionize how we map not just the Moon, but other planetary bodies throughout the solar system. With vast archives of orbital imagery already available, scientists could rapidly generate unprecedented high-resolution topographic maps to support upcoming lunar missions and advance our understanding of planetary geology at scales never before possible.",

      "abstract": "Long-period companions are detected and characterized thanks to long-baseline radial velocity surveys. Combining Doppler time-series with astrometry, and in particular with proper motion anomalies technique, it is possible to put strong constraints on their orbital inclination and true mass. This work aims to present a model that combines Hipparcos and Gaia astrometric data with radial velocity measurements to constrain the orbital inclinations and true masses of long-period companions. Additionally, we re-analyse a small sample of targets that have not yet been studied using this combined approach. This research leverages the simultaneous modelling of proper motion anomalies and radial velocities, in conjunction with an analysis of the sensitivity curve. This approach serves not only as a verification of the parameters but also as a means to acquire valuable insights into planetary systems. The new analyses reveal that some of the targets classified as brown dwarfs or small-mass stars have a planetary nature. HD 5388 b and HD 6718 b are likely planets. HD 141937 b is likely a planet, but the current dataset does not allow us to firmly constrain its true mass. HD 16760 b belongs to the brown dwarf regime and it has a probable second companion. 30 Ari B b falls within the stellar regime, but the presence of an additional stellar companion could compromise the reliability of the final results. For HD 148427 b, HD 96127 b and HIP 65891 b we determined a range for the orbital inclinations.",

      "abstract": "Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are among the most primitive remnants of the early Solar System, and constraining their sizes, shapes, albedos, and surface properties is essential for understanding their origin and evolution. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape measurements for TNOs, while photometry constrains their albedo and surface colours. (28978) Ixion is one of the largest TNOs and a prominent Plutino, making it a key target for comparative studies. We aim to constrain Ixion's projected size, shape, absolute magnitude, geometric albedo, and surface colours, and to search for evidence of an atmosphere or circum-object material. We analysed stellar occultation campaigns by Ixion conducted between 2020 and 2023 within the Lucky Star collaboration, comprising 51 observations from eight events, including 30 positive detections. Five multi-chord events enabled a global limb fit and an accurate reconstruction of Ixion's projected shape. The occultations reveal a slightly elongated limb well represented by a single projected ellipse, yielding an area-equivalent diameter of $D_{\\mathrm{equiv}} = 696.78^{+10.75}_{-8.87}$ km and an apparent oblateness $ε' = 0.081^{+0.004}_{-0.010}$. Typical radial residuals of order $\\sim$10 km indicate a largely stable shape across epochs, with modest epoch-dependent variations. Calibrated photometric data yield an absolute magnitude of $H_V = 3.845 \\pm 0.006$, a phase-curve slope of $β= 0.1301 \\pm 0.0078$ mag deg$^{-1}$, and a visible geometric albedo of $p_V = 0.106^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, with colours consistent with moderately red TNO surfaces. No atmosphere or circum-object material is detected down to our sensitivity limits. The best-sampled event also allows a precise measurement of the angular diameter of the occulted star Gaia DR3 4056440205544338944, $θ_\\star = 0.670 \\pm 0.010$ mas.",

For all 173 objects the median number of observational epochs was 62 with a median time frame of 5.25 years, resulting in median uncertainties of $σ$($π_{abs}$) = 1.51 mas, $σ$($μ_{abs}$) = 1.02 mas yr$^{-1}$, and $σ$($V_{\\rm tan}$) = 1.01 km s$^{-1}$. Our observations provide the first parallax/proper motion results for 16 objects and the highest precision parallaxes/proper motions for an additional 116 objects. A serendipitous overlap of 40 objects with Gaia DR3 astrometry allows direct comparison and confirmation of our results, along with an investigation on the effects of resolved binarity on astrometric results. We also provide a uniform set of $J$-, $H$-, $K_{S}$-band photometry in the UKIRT/MKO system, most of it being from new observations.

      "abstract": "Large regions of gaseous planets are thought to be stratified with an unstable thermal gradient, but a stabilising gradient of heavy element composition. Fluid in these regions is unstable to semi-convection, with motions driven by differences in the molecular diffusivity of temperature and composition, and could play a role in supporting planetary magnetic fields. Previous studies focus largely on local models in Cartesian boxes; here, we investigate semi-convection in rotating spherical shells. The onset of linear instability shows a transition between the two limits of rotating convection and non-rotating semi-convection. Non-linear simulations evolve into a system of concentric layers of relatively constant density, separated by narrow high-gradient regions. These layers gradually merge, resulting in a statistically steady state dominated by either a single convection region or a narrower convective zone beneath a stably stratified layer (SSL), depending on the strength of the thermal forcing compared to the rotation. When magnetic field generation is considered, our magnetohydrodynamic simulations exhibit self-sustained dynamo action. In cases where the turbulent convective region generates magnetic fields that are smoothed by zonal flows within the overlying SSL, the resulting field is strongly dipolar and axisymmetric, in encouraging agreement with Saturn's observed magnetic field. Within the regimes explored, both the Rossby number and the thickness of the SSL are well predicted by a single combination of control parameters. This enables the identification of a parameter range in which the generated magnetic fields resemble those of planetary dynamos.",
