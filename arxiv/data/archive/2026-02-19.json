      "title": "Planet-Disk Interactions and the Convective Overstability. I. Low Mass Planets",
      "abstract": "Rapid inward migration driven by Type I torques threatens the survival of low-mass planets in their nascent protoplanetary disks (PPDs). Positive co-rotation torques offer a potential solution, but require viscous diffusion to remain unsaturated. However, it is unclear if (magneto)-hydrodynamic turbulence provides the necessary diffusion, and disk profiles supporting such torques are often also susceptible to the Convective Overstability (COS) for suitable gas cooling timescales. To this end, we investigate torques on low-mass planets through radially global 2D (razor-thin) and vertically unstratified 3D hydrodynamic simulations of PPDs with thermal diffusion and optically thin cooling. Our 3D models with thermal diffusion, which allows COS development, show systematically different torque behavior compared to 2D models, wherein COS is absent. In 3D, the COS saturates into large-scale, long-lived vortices that migrate radially and interact gravitationally with the embedded planet. When these vortices encounter the planet, they typically provide positive torque \"kicks\" counteracting inward migration, as the less-massive vortices are scattered onto horseshoe orbits by the more-massive planet. We validate our simulation methods against the theoretical framework of Paardekooper et al. (2011) and demonstrate that COS-induced torque modifications can extend migration timescales by factors of approximately 10. For plausible disk models, our results suggest that COS activity can lengthen migration timescales sufficiently to overlap with, or even exceed Super-Earth formation windows (0.1-5 Myr). In contrast, simulations with optically thin cooling do not show significant torque modifications, as COS saturates in near-axisymmetric structures without producing large-scale vortices for the disk models considered here.",

      "abstract": "Context. Characterization of warm giants is crucial to constrain giant planet formation and evolution. Measuring the mass and radius of these planets, combined with their moderated irradiation, allows us to estimate their planetary bulk composition, which is a key quantity to comprehend giant planet formation and structure. Aims. We present the discovery of two transiting warm giant planets orbiting solar-type stars from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which were characterized by further spectroscopic and photometric ground-based observations. Methods. We performed a joint analysis of photometric data with radial velocities to confirm and characterize TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b, two sub-Saturns orbiting solar-like stars. Results. TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b have masses of 0.123 ± 0.012 M_J and 0.213 ± 0.024 M_J, radius of 0.604 ± 0.028 R_J and 0.991 ± 0.044 R_J, periods of 10.06 d and 12.85 d and equilibrium temperature of 1086 ± 19 K and 1040 ± 19 K, respectively. Conclusions. While having similar masses, orbital periods and stellar host properties, these planets seem to have different internal compositions, which could point to distinct formation histories. Both planets are suitable targets for atmospheric studies to further constrain formation scenarios of planets in the Neptune-Saturn mass range",

      "abstract": "Recent simultaneous multiwavelength observations of a nearby young solar-type star EK Dra in the optical, Hα spectrum, and X-ray, have provided evidence for stellar prominence eruptions associated with superflares. The large prominence eruption is suggested to have been caused by a large mid-latitude spot on the polarity inversion lines near the stellar limb from the concurrent Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and optical photometry by the TESS. In this study, we perform starspot mapping for the TESS data of EK Dra to investigate the relation of starspots and magnetic fields from the photometry and ZDI. We also explore the multiwavelength rotational variability ascribed to starspots and active regions for the TESS, B-band, Hα, and X-ray light curves. As a result, we find that (i) spot locations deduced from the TESS light curve are mostly consistent with the intensity map from the ZDI except for a polar spot, and (ii) the Hα light curve exhibits clear periodicity with respect to the TESS light curve because the Hα line is radiated around spots in the chromosphere. The X-ray light curve does not show such association probably because of multiple spots on high activity level and extended spatial structure of coronal active regions. The results provide clues to explore their association with stellar flares at different heights of active regions in chromospheric and coronal lines. Our study also enables us to quantify the stellar XUV radiation from the magnetic fields of active stars toward understanding atmospheric evolution of exoplanets.",

We provide a new set of benchmark photolysis rates for additional species both for Solar irradiance and when irradiated by an M dwarf host star. In general, the higher actinic flux at far-UV and shorter wavelengths of the M dwarf compared to the Sun drives increased photolysis rates for reactions with high threshold energies.

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nImagine trying to understand how a recipe works without knowing what happens when you mix the ingredients. That's the challenge scientists face when studying atmospheres on distant planets called exoplanets. When starlight hits a planet's atmosphere, it breaks apart molecules in a process called photolysis—like how sunlight can fade your car's paint over time, but much more dramatic. Understanding these reactions is crucial because they determine whether a planet could support life, what gases we might detect in its atmosphere, and how similar or different it might be from Earth. This research helps scientists decode the \"chemical recipes\" happening in alien skies.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers used a sophisticated computer program called Socrates to calculate how quickly different molecules break apart when hit by light from two types of stars: our Sun and smaller, cooler stars called M dwarfs. Think of it like figuring out how fast different materials would dissolve under different colored lights. They tested their calculations against previous scientific work to make sure their results were accurate, similar to how a chef might compare their recipe against a trusted cookbook. They examined dozens of different atmospheric molecules, including some found in Earth's air and others that might exist in the exotic atmospheres of distant worlds.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe team discovered that planets orbiting M dwarf stars—the most common type of star in our galaxy—experience much more intense molecular breakup than Earth does. M dwarfs emit more high-energy ultraviolet light, which acts like a stronger \"molecular sledgehammer\" compared to our gentler Sun. This means atmospheres around these stars undergo faster and more dramatic chemical changes. The researchers also found that their new calculations largely agreed with previous work, but revealed some important differences when accounting for how temperature and pressure affect these reactions.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThis research provides scientists with a crucial toolkit for interpreting observations from space telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope. When we detect gases in exoplanet atmospheres, understanding photolysis rates helps determine whether we're seeing a stable atmosphere or one being rapidly transformed by its star's radiation—critical information in the search for potentially habitable worlds.",

Understanding these reactions is crucial because they determine whether a planet could support life, what gases we might detect in its atmosphere, and how similar or different it might be from Earth. This research helps scientists decode the \"chemical recipes\" happening in alien skies.</p>\n<h4>What They Did</h4>\n<p>The researchers used a sophisticated computer program called Socrates to calculate how quickly different molecules break apart when hit by light from two types of stars: our Sun and smaller, cooler stars called M dwarfs. Think of it like figuring out how fast different materials would dissolve under different colored lights. They tested their calculations against previous scientific work to make sure their results were accurate, similar to how a chef might compare their recipe against a trusted cookbook. They examined dozens of different atmospheric molecules, including some found in Earth's air and others that might exist in the exotic atmospheres of distant worlds.</p>\n<h4>Key Findings</h4>\n<p>The team discovered that planets orbiting M dwarf stars—the most common type of star in our galaxy—experience much more intense molecular breakup than Earth does. M dwarfs emit more high-energy ultraviolet light, which acts like a stronger \"molecular sledgehammer\" compared to our gentler Sun. This means atmospheres around these stars undergo faster and more dramatic chemical changes. The researchers also found that their new calculations largely agreed with previous work, but revealed some important differences when accounting for how temperature and pressure affect these reactions.</p>\n<h4>Looking Forward</h4>\n<p>This research provides scientists with a crucial toolkit for interpreting observations from space telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope. When we detect gases in exoplanet atmospheres, understanding photolysis rates helps determine whether we're seeing a stable atmosphere or one being rapidly transformed by its star's radiation—critical information in the search for potentially habitable worlds.</p>",
