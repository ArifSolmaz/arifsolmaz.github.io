      "title": "Possible favored Great Oxidation Event scenario on exoplanets around M-Stars with the example of TRAPPIST-1e",
      "abstract": "The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), which marked the transition from an anoxic to an oxygenated atmosphere, occurred 2.4 billion years ago on Earth, several hundreds of millions of years after the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis. This long delay implies that specific conditions in terms of biomass productivity and burial were necessary to trigger the GOE. It could be a limiting factor for the development of oxygenated atmospheres on inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we explore the specificities of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of an M dwarf for a GOE. Using a 1D coupled photochemical-climate model, we simulate the atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, an Earth-like exoplanet, exploring the effect of oxygen sources (biotic or abiotic). Our results show that the stellar energy distribution promotes O3 production at lower O2 concentrations compared to Earth, and the ozone layer on TRAPPIST-1 e forms more efficiently. This lowers the threshold for atmospheric oxidation, suggesting that the GOE on TRAPPIST-1 e would occur quickly after the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis, up to 1Gyrs earlier than on Earth, and would reach O2 enabling oxygenic respiration and thus the development of animals. We may question whether this is a general behavior around several M-stars. Furthermore, we discuss how the overproduction of ozone could make O3 detection possible using the James Webb Space Telescope, providing a potential method to observe oxygenation signatures on exoplanets in the near future. Previous studies predicted that for an Earth-like atmosphere O3 would require over 150 transits for detection, but our results show that significantly fewer transits could be needed.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nEarth's history includes a dramatic transformation that made complex life possible: the Great Oxidation Event. About 2.4 billion years ago, our planet's atmosphere suddenly filled with oxygen, paving the way for animals to eventually evolve.

Scientists have wondered whether planets orbiting other stars could undergo similar transformations—and if so, how we might detect them. This research explores whether Earth-like planets around the most common type of star in our galaxy, called M dwarfs, might actually have an easier path to developing oxygen-rich atmospheres than Earth did.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers used computer models to simulate the atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, a potentially habitable planet orbiting a red dwarf star about 40 light-years away. Think of it like creating a detailed weather forecast, but instead of predicting tomorrow's conditions, they're modeling how a planet's entire atmosphere might change over billions of years.

      "title": "The Role of Intrinsic Temperature and Vertical Mixing in Characterizing Sub-Neptune Atmospheres",
      "abstract": "Sub-Neptune planets are often modeled with a dense rocky or metal-rich interior beneath a thick hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere; though their bulk densities could also be explained by a water-rich interior with a thin H/He atmosphere. Atmospheric composition provides a key mechanism to break this degeneracy between competing interior models. However, the overall composition of sub-Neptunes inferred from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope, remains debated in part due to differences in modeling assumptions. While previous studies explored parameter spaces such as stellar spectra, atmospheric metallicities, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios, they often assumed fixed intrinsic temperatures (Tint) and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients (Kzz) - two critical, yet poorly constrained, drivers of atmospheric chemistry. To address this, we present a self-consistent grid of models that covers the full plausible range of Tint (60 - 450 K) and Kzz (10^(5) - 10^(12) cm^2/s) using the open-source PICASO and VULCAN packages to better characterize sub-Neptune atmospheres. Focusing on K2-18b analogs, we demonstrate that Tint and Kzz significantly impact CH4, CO2, CO, NH3 and HCN abundances, with H2O being largely unaffected. Our work demonstrates that comprehensive parameter space exploration of thermal and mixing parameters is essential for accurate interpretation of sub-Neptune spectra, and that single-parameter assumptions can lead to misclassification of planetary interiors. We provide a diagnostic framework using multi-molecule observations to distinguish between competing atmospheric models and advance robust characterization of sub-Neptunes.",

      "title": "Atmospheric Circulation of High-Obliquity Mini-Neptunes",
      "abstract": "With the operation of JWST, atmospheric characterization has now extended to low-mass exoplanets. In compact multiplanetary systems, secular spin-orbital resonance may preserve high obliquities and asynchronous rotation even for tidally-despinning, low-mass planets, potentially leading to unique atmospheric circulation patterns. To understand the impact on the atmospheric circulation and to identify the potential atmospheric observational signatures of such high-obliquity planets, we simulate the three dimensional circulation of a representative mini-Neptune K2-290 b, whose obliquity may reach about 67 degrees. Whether synchronously rotating or not, the planet's slow rotation, moderate temperature and radius result in a global Weak-Temperature-Gradient (WTG) behavior with moderate horizontal temperature contrasts. Under synchronous rotation, broad eastward superrotating jets efficiently redistribute heat. Circulation in an asynchronous rotation exhibits a seasonal cycle driven by high obliquity, along with quasi-periodic oscillations in winds and temperatures with a period of about 70 orbital periods. These oscillations, driven by wave-mean flow interactions, extend from low to mid-latitudes due to the slow planetary rotation. Higher atmospheric metallicity strengthens radiative forcing, increasing temperature contrasts and jet speeds. Clouds have minimal impact under synchronous rotation but weaken jets under nonsynchronous rotation by reducing temperature contrasts. In all cases, both thermal emission and transmission spectra exhibit moderate observational signals at a level of 100 ppm, and high-obliquity effects contribute differences at the 10 ppm level. Our results are also applicable to a range of potential high-obliquity exoplanets, which reside in the WTG regime and likely exhibit nearly homogeneous horizontal temperature patterns.",

      "title": "Timescales diagnostics for saving viscous and MHD-driven dusty discs from external photoevaporation",
      "abstract": "The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modelled via an α parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.",
