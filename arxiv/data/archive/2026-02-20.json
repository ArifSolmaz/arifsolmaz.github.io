      "title": "Asteroidal activity amongst meteor datasets: Confirmed new \"rock-comet\" stream and search for a tidal disruption signature",
      "abstract": "Asteroid activity (e.g., thermo-mechanical breakdown, impacts, rotational shedding, tidal disruption, etc.) can inject meteoroids into near-Earth space and leave detectable signatures in orbit catalogs. We searched for such recent signatures using orbit-similarity statistics and explicit null-hypothesis testing applied to shower-removed, asteroidal video-meteor datasets. Our sample comprises 235,271 meteors and fireballs from four all-sky video networks (GMN, CAMS, EDMOND, and SonotaCo). For meteors we use the geocentric dissimilarity criterion D_N and construct KDE-based sporadic null realizations to evaluate (i) global cumulative similarity distributions and (ii) localized D_N-conditioned (D_N<0.015) pair-excess maps in the (U,λ_☉) plane; we additionally apply DBSCAN (ε=0.03, min=2) to isolate the coherent, statistically significant structures. We find no survey-consistent, stream-like signature in the Earth-like, low-inclination region expected for a distinct recent tidal-disruption family; instead, significant-bin membership implies, under our adopted detection thresholds and binning, a conservative combined upper limit of ≤ 53/235,271 (≤ 2.3×10⁻⁴) for sporadic asteroidal meteors plausibly attributable to a detectable recent tidal-disruption-like contribution. In contrast, we confirm the detection of a new diffuse southern Virginid-region stream: GMN exhibits a local z-score of 6.32 relative to the KDE-null mean in the U-λ_☉ phase space (global significance of 5.3 σ), with weaker supporting excess in SonotaCo and EDMOND. DBSCAN isolates N=282 members (243 GMN plus additional SonotaCo, CAMS, and EDMOND) on a low-perihelion, asteroidal orbit (q=0.22±0.01 au, i=12.3ⁱrc±1.8ⁱrc, T_J=4.6±0.3) consistent with near-Sun thermo-mechanical ``rock-comet'' activity.",

      "title": "On Eccentric Protoplanetary Disks I -- How Eccentric are Planet-Perturbed Disks?",
      "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks can become eccentric when planets open deep gaps within, but how eccentric are they? We answer this question by analyzing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interaction. The steady state eccentricity of the outer disk (outside of the planet's orbit) is described as a balance between eccentricity excitation by the 1:3 eccentric Lindblad resonance and eccentricity damping by gas pressure. This eccentricity scales with q(hₚrₚ)⁽⁻¹⁾(rgₐₚrₚ)⁽a⁻b2-2), where q is the planet-to-star mass ratio, hₚrₚ is the disk aspect ratio, rgₐₚrₚ is the radial position of the outer gap edge divided by the planet's position, and a and b are the negative exponents in the disk's surface density and temperature power law profiles, respectively. We derive a semi-analytic eccentricity profile that agrees with numerical simulations to within 30%. Our result is a first step to quantitatively interpret observations of eccentric protoplanetary disks, such as MWC 758, HD 142527, IRS 48, and CI Tau.",

      "title": "Analytical modeling of helium absorption signals of isothermal atmospheric escape",
      "abstract": "Atmospheric escape driven by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is a critical process shaping the evolution of close-in exoplanets. Recent observations have detected helium triplet absorption in numerous (>20) close-in exoplanets, highlighting the importance of understanding upper atmospheric thermo-chemical structure. While super-solar metallicity has been observed in the atmospheres of some close-in exoplanets, the impact of metal species on both atmospheric escape dynamics and observed absorption features remains poorly understood. In this study, we derive a simplified yet accurate formula for the equivalent width of helium absorption in the limit of an isothermal temperature for the upper atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that planets with lower temperature (metal-rich atmosphere) exhibit lower mass-loss rate although the equivalent width of helium triplet absorption remains largely independent of atmospheric temperature (metallicity) because the low temperatures in these atmospheres enhance the fraction of helium in its triplet state. Additionally, we present a hydrodynamic model based on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that incorporates the effects of metal cooling. Our analytical model can predict the helium triplet equivalent width of the atmosphere of simulations. The analytical model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how metal cooling in the upper atmosphere influences the thermo-chemical structure and observable helium features of close-in exoplanetary atmospheres, offering valuable insights for interpreting current and future observational data.",

      "abstract": "Close-in exoplanets with H/He atmospheres often undergo hydrodynamic escape. In extreme cases, it is hypothesized that the mass loss can be high enough for the escaping planetary material to wrap around the star, forming a long-lasting circumstellar torus. In this work, we develop a physical model of such circumstellar tori and use a ray tracing scheme to calculate the attenuation of stellar light passing through them. We show that the presence of a circumstellar torus significantly increases the equivalent width of the observed stellar He I 10830 Å line. When combined with observations of the star's Ca II H & K lines, these systems can typically be distinguished from field stars. Based on these results, we propose a survey of stars hosting close-in planets, combining observations of the He I 10830 Å and Ca II H & K lines to search for circumstellar tori generated from planetary mass-loss in these systems.",

Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of NASA, equipped with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, and Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment, has enabled detailed Sun-as-a-star studies that bridge solar and stellar physics. Integrating spatially resolved solar observations into disk-integrated datasets, these studies provide insights into magnetic activity occurring in distant stars. This review highlights key results from recent analyses that employed all three SDO instruments to characterize active regions, quantify universal heating relationships, and reconstruct stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra.

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nStars across the galaxy are magnetic powerhouses, generating powerful energy fields that can make or break the chances for life on nearby planets. But studying these distant stellar magnetic fields directly is nearly impossible—imagine trying to examine a lightbulb's filament from across town. That's where our Sun becomes invaluable. As the only star we can study up close, our Sun serves as a cosmic laboratory, helping scientists understand how all stars work and what this means for planets orbiting them. This research matters because it helps us predict which exoplanets might have protective atmospheres and stable climates suitable for life.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nResearchers used NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, a space-based telescope that watches our Sun 24/7, to create a clever experimental setup. Think of it like using a high-powered microscope to study individual cells, then stepping back to see how the whole organism behaves. The scientists took detailed, close-up images of specific active regions on the Sun—areas crackling with magnetic energy like cosmic storms—and then combined this data to simulate what distant telescopes would see when looking at other stars.

      "summary_html": "<h4>Why It Matters</h4>\n<p>Stars across the galaxy are magnetic powerhouses, generating powerful energy fields that can make or break the chances for life on nearby planets. But studying these distant stellar magnetic fields directly is nearly impossible—imagine trying to examine a lightbulb's filament from across town. That's where our Sun becomes invaluable. As the only star we can study up close, our Sun serves as a cosmic laboratory, helping scientists understand how all stars work and what this means for planets orbiting them. This research matters because it helps us predict which exoplanets might have protective atmospheres and stable climates suitable for life.</p>\n<h4>What They Did</h4>\n<p>Researchers used NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, a space-based telescope that watches our Sun 24/7, to create a clever experimental setup. Think of it like using a high-powered microscope to study individual cells, then stepping back to see how the whole organism behaves. The scientists took detailed, close-up images of specific active regions on the Sun—areas crackling with magnetic energy like cosmic storms—and then combined this data to simulate what distant telescopes would see when looking at other stars.

      "title": "Using EUV driven external photoevaporation to test viscous evolution of protoplanetary discs",
      "abstract": "Protoplanetary discs are thought to evolve either through angular momentum transport driven by viscous processes or through angular momentum removal induced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. One proposed method to distinguish between these two evolutionary pathways is by comparing mass accretion rates and disc sizes, but observational constraints complicate this distinction. In this study, we investigate how extreme ultraviolet (EUV) external photoevaporation affects the evolution of protoplanetary discs, particularly in environments such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using a combination of analytical derivations and 1D numerical simulations, we explore the impact of externally induced mass-loss on disc structure and accretion dynamics. We demonstrate that, in the viscous scenario, there exists a clear, near one-to-one correlation between the mass-loss rate due to external photoevaporative outflows and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. In contrast, MHD wind-driven discs do not exhibit such trend, leading to a distinct evolutionary path. External photoevaporative mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates can both be accurately measured for a population of discs, without a strong model dependence. Thus, our findings provide a robust observational test to distinguish between viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution, offering a new approach to constraining angular momentum transport mechanisms in protoplanetary discs. Applying this diagnostic observationally requires joint measurements of M ₐcc and M ₚₑ for the same objects, which are currently scarce in bright HII regions due to contamination and sensitivity limitations.",

      "title": "A Collective Trigger for Widespread Planetesimal Formation Revealed by Accretion Ages",
      "abstract": "The formation of planetesimals was an integral part of the cascading series of processes that built the terrestrial planets. To illuminate planetesimal formation, here we develop a refined thermal evolution model to calculate the formation ages of meteorite parent planetesimals. This model includes chemical reactions and phase changes during heating, as well as natural variations in the proportions of the constituent phases of these planetesimals. We find that the parent bodies of non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorites start forming at very similar times ( 0.95 Myr after calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion [CAI] formation) and occupy overlapping time windows. NC and CC chondrite parent bodies formed later during non-overlapping periods. We combine these ages with proportions of isotopic end-members we recover from mixing models to construct records of motion throughout the protoplanetary disk. These records argue that NC and CC material traversed the barrier in the disk after 0.95 Myr after CAI formation. The onset of this motion coincided with planetesimal formation, indicating that the phenomenon that drove motion also triggered planetesimal formation. We argue that this feature also served as the semi-permeable barrier in the disk. Although its identity is uncertain, the effects this phenomenon had on the timing of planetesimal formation and motion through the disk can now serve as constraints on models of disk evolution. Models that reproduce these effects would elucidate the nature and implications of this phenomenon, which is key to unlocking a holistic model of terrestrial planet building.",
