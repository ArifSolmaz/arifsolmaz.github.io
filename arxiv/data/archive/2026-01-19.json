      "abstract": "We present observations and analysis of the bound planetary microlensing event KMT-2025-BLG-1616. The planetary signal was captured by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and the DECam Rogue Earths and Mars Survey (DREAMS). DREAMS's minute-cadence observations break the central/resonant degeneracy in the binary-lens models. The color of the faint source star ($I=22$) is measured from the DREAMS's $r - z$ color. The planetary system has a planet-host mass ratio of $q \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-4}$. A Bayesian analysis yields a host-star mass of $\\sim 0.3\\,M_\\odot$, a planetary mass of $\\sim 40\\,M_{\\oplus}$, a projected planet-host separation of $\\sim 1.6~\\mathrm{au}$, and a lens distance of $\\sim 7.5~\\mathrm{kpc}$. Based on the photometric precision achieved by DREAMS for this event, we simulate free-floating planet (FFP) detections and find that DREAMS is sensitive to Mars-mass FFPs in the Galactic bulge and Moon-mass FFPs in the Galactic disk.",

      "title": "Central flashes during stellar occultations. Effects of diffraction, interferences, and stellar diameter",
      "abstract": "Central flashes occur during stellar occultations by solar system objects. We catalog diffraction effects on the flash with point-like stars, monochromatic waves and spherical transparent atmosphere. Diffraction involves the Huygens principle, the Sommerfeld lemma and the stationary phase method, while finite stellar diameter cases involve Clausius' theorem. For point-like stars, the central flash shape is that of the classical Poisson spot, but with larger height. For tenuous atmospheres that cannot focus the stellar rays at shadow center, the flash is amplified by the factor (R_0/r_0)^2 compared to the Poisson spot, where R0 and r0 are the object and the shadow radii, respectively. For denser atmospheres that can focus the rays at shadow center, the flash peaks at 2[(pi*R/lambda_F})^2]*phi0, where R is the central flash layer radius, lambda_F is the Fresnel scale and phi0 is the flux that would be observed at shadow center without focusing. For isothermal atmospheres with scale height H, the height is 2(R*H)(pi/lambda_F)^2. Fringes surrounding the central flash are separated by lambda_P=lambda_F^2/R, related to the separation between the primary and secondary stellar images. For a projected stellar diameter D*>lambda_P, the flash is described by complete elliptic integrals, and has full width at half maximum of 1.14D* and peak value 8H/D*. For Earth-based occultations by Pluto and Triton observed in the visible with point-like stars, diffraction causes flashes with very large heights ~10e4-10e5, spread over a very small meter-sized region in the shadow plane. In practice, the flash is usually smoothed by the stellar diameter, but still reaches high values of ~50 and ~200 during Pluto and Triton occultations, respectively. Diffraction dominates when using millimeter wavelengths or longer. Effects of departure from sphericity, atmospheric waves and stellar limb darkening are discussed.",

Here we present Doppler tomography of three known hot Jupiters to determine their {\\lambda} orientation: HAT-P-49 b, HAT-P-57A b, and XO-3A b. Our analysis explores the impact of cross-correlation processing methods on the detectability and characterization of the planet's Doppler shadow using up to three independent routines for cross-correlation functions extraction; those being: Yabi, iSpec and IRAF. After accounting for differences among the results obtained with the various routines, we report: first, the HAT-P-49 system is a case of a hot Jupiter on a polar orbit with {\\lambda}=-85.3{\\pm}1.7{\\deg}, second, HAT-P-57A indicates practically no deviation of the planet's projected orbit from the host's equatorial plane with {\\lambda}=-0.4^{+1.4}_{-1.9}{\\deg}, and third, the XO-3A system with the measured value of {\\lambda}=38{+3}_{-4}{\\deg} lies in between an aligned and a perpendicular orientation, which is a less populated region of the spin-orbit distribution. Our findings highlight both the diversity of spin-orbit angles among close-in giant planets and the potential discrepancies in their measurement that can arise from different approaches to constructing the cross-correlation functions.",

      "title": "Detection of four cold Jupiters through combined analyses of radial velocity and astrometry data",
      "abstract": "Cold Jupiters play a crucial role in planet formation and dynamical evolution. Since their initial discovery around 47 UMa, they have attracted significant interest, yet their formation mechanisms remain uncertain, underscoring the need to expand the known population. In this work, we combine RV data with Gaia astrometry using Hipparcos-Gaia proper-motion anomalies over a 25-year baseline. By jointly modeling both datasets with the MCMC framework, we constrain planetary masses, orbital inclinations, and three-dimensional orbital architectures. This reduces RV degeneracies and improves mass determinations. Four cold Jupiters are reported: HD 68475 b and HD 100508 b are each the first confirmed planet in their systems, with orbital periods $7832_{-323}^{+463}$ d and $5681\\pm42$ d and dynamical masses of $5.16_{-0.47}^{+0.53} M_{\\text{Jup}}$ and $1.2_{-0.18}^{+0.30} M_{\\text{Jup}}$, respectively. In multi-planet systems, HD 48265 c has a period of $10418_{-1400}^{+2400}$ d and a mass of $3.71_{-0.43}^{+0.68} M_{\\text{Jup}}$, while HD 114386 c orbits at $444.00_{-0.88}^{+0.93}$ d with a minimum mass of $0.37 \\pm 0.03 M_{\\text{Jup}}$. The two planets in the HD 48265 system may exhibit a significant mutual inclination, making it a target for testing the von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov mechanism. HD 68475 b is a promising candidate for future direct imaging with ELT/METIS. We identified a Jupiter analog with the longest known orbital period among planets with masses between 0.5 and 2 $M_{\\text{Jup}}$, implying that a substantial population of cold Jupiters likely awaits discovery by Gaia. This study expands the sample of cold Jupiters with constrained orbits and dynamical masses, demonstrating the value of combining radial velocity and astrometry in exoplanet research.",

For the jet morphology, we measure the PA at multiple epochs by applying the Larson-Sekanina Rotational Gradient filter to Hubble Space Telescope images between November 20, 2025 and December 27, 2025, and model the phase-folded PA curve with weighted least-squares Fourier series up to two harmonics while scanning trial periods P to identify minima in \\c{hi}2(P). For the photometry, we adopt the best-fit period from an independent 30-minute binned analysis (from a 0.25 meter telescope MPC L92) based on a refined \\c{hi}2(P) profile for a sinusoidal model with nightly offsets. We find that the jet-PA modulation gives a period Pjet = 7.20 +/-0.05 h (adopting a conservative uncertainty dominated by sparse sampling and systematics), while the photometry yields Pphot = 7.136+/-0.001 h (formal 1{\\sigma} uncertainty). Although the periods differ slightly, the offset is plausibly attributable to non-Gaussian systematics and aliasing. The combined data supports a post-perihelion rotation period of 7.1 h associated with precession of the jet structure around the rotation axis by 20{\\deg}. The rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within 20{\\deg}",

      "abstract": "We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia.",

To this end, we have developed Metal Pipe, a new code for determining stellar parameters and abundances, which is designed for use across a wider range of spectral types than many commonly used codes. It combines the widely-used package MOOG with photometric stellar parameters, a user-supplied high-resolution spectrum, and a newly curated list of spectral lines. Metal Pipe outputs values for $T_{\\rm{eff}}$, $\\log{(g)}$, $M_*$, $R_*$, and $L_*$ from isochrones, and abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe from MOOG. In this paper, we describe the Metal Pipe algorithm and tests of Metal Pipe against previous abundance measurements on archival HIRES spectra of 503 F, G, and K type stars. We find RMS scatters of ~100 K in $T_{\\rm{eff}}$, ~0.10 dex in $\\log{(g)}$, and ~0.10 dex for all measured abundances. These values are comparable to estimated measurement uncertainties, verifying Metal Pipe for continued use in building a detailed abundance catalog.

Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\\~no Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.",

The method has been used for over 90 comet apparitions (Combi 2022; Combi et al. 2019). A water production rate of 3.17 x 10^29 s^-1 was found on November 6 when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 1.40 au and at a sufficient solar elongation angle.

      "abstract": "In October 2024 JWST observed a transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog planet on a 1000+ day orbit. These observations, recorded over a long baseline of nearly 60 hours, were designed to search for signatures of planetary oblateness and/or exomoons comparable to Ganymede. In this first in a series of studies analyzing these data we report on constraints on Kepler-167e's oblateness. We explored a large grid of data reduction pipelines and modeling choices, including a new entirely independent reduction pipeline (\"katahdin\") and two new treatments for limb darkening. We find that under a Bayesian model comparison framework the data are fit equally well by both spherical and oblate planet models, and that our ability to constrain the oblateness is negatively impacted by the influence of exposure-long trends. Using the most conservative of our posteriors, we place a 95% upper bound on the projected oblateness of $f<0.097$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P\\geq7.11$ hours if the planet's spin axis is aligned with the sky plane. We note, however, that the final bound depends on the choice of reduction pipeline and systematics model, and that our suite of end-to-end analyses produced bounds as low as $f<0.065$ at 95%. We conclude that leveraging JWST to make tighter constraints on planetary oblateness will require further investigation into mitigating exposure-long trends and correlated noise.",

This represents one of the first attempts to measure such subtle planetary shapes outside our solar system, opening new ways to understand how these distant worlds spin and evolved.\n\n**What They Did**\nResearchers observed Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-sized planet located over 1,000 light-years away, as it passed in front of its star during a nearly 60-hour observation period in October 2024. They developed multiple independent analysis methods, including a new data processing pipeline called \"katahdin,\" to search for tiny variations in the transit that would reveal if the planet is squashed into an oval shape rather than perfectly round.\n\n**Key Findings**\nThe team couldn't definitively determine whether Kepler-167e is oblate (flattened) or spherical, as both models fit the data equally well. They established that if the planet is flattened, it's spinning no faster than once every 7.11 hours - much quicker than Jupiter's 10-hour day. The most conservative analysis suggests the planet's oblateness is less than 9.7%, though some methods yielded tighter constraints of 6.5%. Technical challenges from long-term trends in the telescope data limited their ability to make more precise measurements.\n\n**Looking Forward**\nThis pioneering study demonstrates that JWST has the potential to measure planetary shapes beyond our solar system, but reveals that better techniques for handling telescope systematics will be needed for more precise results.

This represents one of the first attempts to measure such subtle planetary shapes outside our solar system, opening new ways to understand how these distant worlds spin and evolved.\n<h4>What They Did</h4>\nResearchers observed Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-sized planet located over 1,000 light-years away, as it passed in front of its star during a nearly 60-hour observation period in October 2024. They developed multiple independent analysis methods, including a new data processing pipeline called \"katahdin,\" to search for tiny variations in the transit that would reveal if the planet is squashed into an oval shape rather than perfectly round.\n<h4>Key Findings</h4>\nThe team couldn't definitively determine whether Kepler-167e is oblate (flattened) or spherical, as both models fit the data equally well. They established that if the planet is flattened, it's spinning no faster than once every 7.11 hours - much quicker than Jupiter's 10-hour day. The most conservative analysis suggests the planet's oblateness is less than 9.7%, though some methods yielded tighter constraints of 6.5%. Technical challenges from long-term trends in the telescope data limited their ability to make more precise measurements.\n<h4>Looking Forward</h4>\nThis pioneering study demonstrates that JWST has the potential to measure planetary shapes beyond our solar system, but reveals that better techniques for handling telescope systematics will be needed for more precise results. Future observations could eventually tell us how fast distant planets rotate and provide insights into their formation and internal structure.",

      "abstract": "Planned and future missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory, will aim to image Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars in reflected light. Determining whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its star may be difficult in multi-planet systems when the observer does not know in advance which detection corresponds to which planet. This \"confusion\" problem will be a concern for future missions due to the high occurrence rate of multi-planet systems, and will be exacerbated by lack of prior knowledge about planets' orbital parameters or characteristics. We address the planet-detection confusion problem by developing a photometry model and new orbit ranking scheme to augment a \"deconfuser\" tool and account for phase variation exhibited by planets throughout their orbits. We demonstrate the new ranking scheme as a proof-of-concept on a subset of highly confused simulated multi-planet systems among three inclination groupings (low, medium, and high). We find that incorporating photometry improves differentiation of previously confused orbits in more than half of these particularly challenging cases. These results emphasize that photometry is useful for orbit discrimination and deconfusion of directly imaged multi-planet systems, and should be considered when fitting orbits to detections.",

      "abstract": "Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motions and atmospheric compositions. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduced all the available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derived stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references, which we used to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extracted spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derived isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral types, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium-resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosities which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\nUnderstanding where water ice exists on the Moon is crucial for future human exploration and potential lunar bases, as this ice could provide drinking water, oxygen for breathing, and hydrogen for rocket fuel. The Moon's polar regions may harbor billions of tons of frozen water in permanently shadowed craters, making them prime targets for upcoming missions.\n\n**What They Did**\nThe researchers conducted a comprehensive review of different scientific theories about how water ice forms and survives on the Moon, comparing these theoretical models with actual observations from spacecraft and lunar missions. They focused on examining the widely-accepted \"standard model\" that explains ice accumulation in permanently shadowed polar craters against various observational evidence collected over recent decades.\n\n**Key Findings**\nThe standard theory holds up remarkably well against most observational data, supporting the idea that water ice began accumulating in polar craters once the Moon's axis tilted to its current position, creating permanent shadows. This model successfully explains the major patterns scientists observe in lunar ice distribution and behavior.

      "summary_html": "<h4>Why It Matters</h4>\nUnderstanding where water ice exists on the Moon is crucial for future human exploration and potential lunar bases, as this ice could provide drinking water, oxygen for breathing, and hydrogen for rocket fuel. The Moon's polar regions may harbor billions of tons of frozen water in permanently shadowed craters, making them prime targets for upcoming missions.\n<h4>What They Did</h4>\nThe researchers conducted a comprehensive review of different scientific theories about how water ice forms and survives on the Moon, comparing these theoretical models with actual observations from spacecraft and lunar missions. They focused on examining the widely-accepted \"standard model\" that explains ice accumulation in permanently shadowed polar craters against various observational evidence collected over recent decades.\n<h4>Key Findings</h4>\nThe standard theory holds up remarkably well against most observational data, supporting the idea that water ice began accumulating in polar craters once the Moon's axis tilted to its current position, creating permanent shadows. This model successfully explains the major patterns scientists observe in lunar ice distribution and behavior. However, the review identified a few unexplained observational claims that don't quite fit the standard model, suggesting our understanding may need some refinement. Overall, the evidence strongly supports the existence of substantial ice deposits in the Moon's polar cold traps.\n<h4>Looking Forward</h4>\nThese findings validate current mission planning strategies that target permanently shadowed regions for ice extraction and utilization. As more sophisticated instruments visit the Moon in coming years, scientists will be able to test the remaining uncertainties in lunar ice theory and refine our understanding of these valuable resources.",
