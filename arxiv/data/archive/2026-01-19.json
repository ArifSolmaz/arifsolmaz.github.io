      "title": "Detection of four cold Jupiters through combined analyses of radial velocity and astrometry data",
      "abstract": "Cold Jupiters play a crucial role in planet formation and dynamical evolution. Since their initial discovery around 47 UMa, they have attracted significant interest, yet their formation mechanisms remain uncertain, underscoring the need to expand the known population. In this work, we combine RV data with Gaia astrometry using Hipparcos-Gaia proper-motion anomalies over a 25-year baseline. By jointly modeling both datasets with the MCMC framework, we constrain planetary masses, orbital inclinations, and three-dimensional orbital architectures. This reduces RV degeneracies and improves mass determinations. Four cold Jupiters are reported: HD 68475 b and HD 100508 b are each the first confirmed planet in their systems, with orbital periods 7832 (+463/-323) d and 5681±42 d and dynamical masses of 5.16 (+0.53/-0.47) M_(Jup) and 1.2 (+0.30/-0.18) M_(Jup), respectively. In multi-planet systems, HD 48265 c has a period of 10418 (+2400/-1400) d and a mass of 3.71 (+0.68/-0.43) M_(Jup), while HD 114386 c orbits at 444.00 (+0.93/-0.88) d with a minimum mass of 0.37 ± 0.03 M_(Jup). The two planets in the HD 48265 system may exhibit a significant mutual inclination, making it a target for testing the von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov mechanism. HD 68475 b is a promising candidate for future direct imaging with ELT/METIS. We identified a Jupiter analog with the longest known orbital period among planets with masses between 0.5 and 2 M_(Jup), implying that a substantial population of cold Jupiters likely awaits discovery by Gaia. This study expands the sample of cold Jupiters with constrained orbits and dynamical masses, demonstrating the value of combining radial velocity and astrometry in exoplanet research.",

      "abstract": "Although the migration of hot Jupiters is not yet fully understood, measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle λ help shed light on the processes involved. Here we present Doppler tomography of three known hot Jupiters to determine their λ orientation: HAT-P-49 b, HAT-P-57A b, and XO-3A b. Our analysis explores the impact of cross-correlation processing methods on the detectability and characterization of the planet's Doppler shadow using up to three independent routines for cross-correlation functions extraction; those being: Yabi, iSpec and IRAF. After accounting for differences among the results obtained with the various routines, we report: first, the HAT-P-49 system is a case of a hot Jupiter on a polar orbit with λ=-85.3±1.7°, second, HAT-P-57A indicates practically no deviation of the planet's projected orbit from the host's equatorial plane with λ=-0.4 (+1.4/-1.9)°, and third, the XO-3A system with the measured value of λ=38+3_(-4)° lies in between an aligned and a perpendicular orientation, which is a less populated region of the spin-orbit distribution. Our findings highlight both the diversity of spin-orbit angles among close-in giant planets and the potential discrepancies in their measurement that can arise from different approaches to constructing the cross-correlation functions.",

The planetary signal was captured by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and the DECam Rogue Earths and Mars Survey (DREAMS). DREAMS's minute-cadence observations break the central/resonant degeneracy in the binary-lens models. The color of the faint source star (I=22) is measured from the DREAMS's r - z color. The planetary system has a planet-host mass ratio of q ~ 5 × 10^(-4). A Bayesian analysis yields a host-star mass of ~ 0.3\\,M_☉, a planetary mass of ~ 40\\,M_(⊕), a projected planet-host separation of ~ 1.6~au, and a lens distance of ~ 7.5~kpc.

      "title": "The impact of disc photoevaporation on the long-term evolution of giant planets in mean motion resonances",
      "abstract": "We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nImagine two massive planets locked in a cosmic dance, orbiting their star in perfect synchronization—one completes exactly two orbits for every three of its neighbor, like clockwork that's been running for millions of years. These \"resonant\" relationships are surprisingly common among the thousands of exoplanets we've discovered, but scientists have struggled to understand how they form and why some survive while others fall apart. This research tackles a crucial missing piece of the puzzle: how intense stellar radiation that strips away the gas disk around young stars affects these delicate planetary partnerships. Understanding this process helps us decode the life stories of planetary systems and explains why we see such diverse arrangements of worlds beyond our solar system.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers created detailed computer simulations to watch planetary systems evolve over millions of years. They modeled young star systems where two giant planets (similar to Jupiter) orbit in lockstep while embedded in a disk of gas and dust. In their virtual laboratory, they cranked up the intensity of a process called photoevaporation—where the star's intense radiation essentially boils away the surrounding gas disk. They tested different scenarios by varying the disk's mass, how thick or thin the gas was, the planets' weights, and how tightly synchronized the planetary orbits were. Think of it like running multiple experiments to see how different cooking temperatures and ingredient amounts affect the final recipe.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe results revealed a surprising twist: intense stellar radiation can actually stabilize some planetary partnerships that would otherwise break apart. When radiation strips gas from the space between planets, it reduces the gravitational forces that normally push planets out of sync. This stabilizing effect works best for planets in 3:2 resonances (three orbits to two), which are naturally more fragile. However, the process can backfire for planets in 2:1 resonances (two orbits to one), sometimes destabilizing these normally robust relationships. In all cases, the planets end up with more stretched, oval-shaped orbits rather than circular ones.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThese discoveries help explain the incredible diversity of planetary systems we observe today.

      "summary_html": "<h4>Why It Matters</h4>\n<p>Imagine two massive planets locked in a cosmic dance, orbiting their star in perfect synchronization—one completes exactly two orbits for every three of its neighbor, like clockwork that's been running for millions of years. These \"resonant\" relationships are surprisingly common among the thousands of exoplanets we've discovered, but scientists have struggled to understand how they form and why some survive while others fall apart. This research tackles a crucial missing piece of the puzzle: how intense stellar radiation that strips away the gas disk around young stars affects these delicate planetary partnerships. Understanding this process helps us decode the life stories of planetary systems and explains why we see such diverse arrangements of worlds beyond our solar system.</p>\n<h4>What They Did</h4>\n<p>The researchers created detailed computer simulations to watch planetary systems evolve over millions of years. They modeled young star systems where two giant planets (similar to Jupiter) orbit in lockstep while embedded in a disk of gas and dust. In their virtual laboratory, they cranked up the intensity of a process called photoevaporation—where the star's intense radiation essentially boils away the surrounding gas disk. They tested different scenarios by varying the disk's mass, how thick or thin the gas was, the planets' weights, and how tightly synchronized the planetary orbits were. Think of it like running multiple experiments to see how different cooking temperatures and ingredient amounts affect the final recipe.</p>\n<h4>Key Findings</h4>\n<p>The results revealed a surprising twist: intense stellar radiation can actually stabilize some planetary partnerships that would otherwise break apart. When radiation strips gas from the space between planets, it reduces the gravitational forces that normally push planets out of sync. This stabilizing effect works best for planets in 3:2 resonances (three orbits to two), which are naturally more fragile. However, the process can backfire for planets in 2:1 resonances (two orbits to one), sometimes destabilizing these normally robust relationships. In all cases, the planets end up with more stretched, oval-shaped orbits rather than circular ones.</p>\n<h4>Looking Forward</h4>\n<p>These discoveries help explain the incredible diversity of planetary systems we observe today. The research suggests that a star's radiation environment during a system's youth plays a crucial role in sculpting the final arrangement of planets. This has practical implications for upcoming space missions like the European Space Agency's Gaia telescope, which will measure tiny stellar wobbles caused by orbiting planets.

      "title": "Metal Pipe: A Broadly-Applicable Stellar Abundance Pipeline Using Isochronal Parameters",
      "abstract": "Characterizing exoplanet host stars at a population level requires a method of homogeneously characterizing stellar properties across all spectral types. To this end, we have developed Metal Pipe, a new code for determining stellar parameters and abundances, which is designed for use across a wider range of spectral types than many commonly used codes. It combines the widely-used package MOOG with photometric stellar parameters, a user-supplied high-resolution spectrum, and a newly curated list of spectral lines. Metal Pipe outputs values for T_(eff), (g), M_*, R_*, and L_* from isochrones, and abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe from MOOG. In this paper, we describe the Metal Pipe algorithm and tests of Metal Pipe against previous abundance measurements on archival HIRES spectra of 503 F, G, and K type stars. We find RMS scatters of ~100 K in T_(eff), ~0.10 dex in (g), and ~0.10 dex for all measured abundances. These values are comparable to estimated measurement uncertainties, verifying Metal Pipe for continued use in building a detailed abundance catalog. Future papers in this series will test Metal Pipe's applicability to late K and M dwarf stars, and provide other improvements.",
