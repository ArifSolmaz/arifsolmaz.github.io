      "title": "sponchpop II: Population Synthesis to Investigate Volatile Sulfur as a Fingerprint of Gas Giant Formation Histories",
      "abstract": "Planet population synthesis is an integral tool for linking exoplanets to their formation environments. Most planet population synthesis studies have focused on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in gas or solids, yet more insight into planet formation may be afforded by considering a wider suite of elements. Sulfur is one such key element. It has been assumed to be entirely refractory in population synthesis models, restricting it to being a tracer of accreted rocky solids. However, sulfur also has a volatile reservoir dominant at the onset of star and planet formation. We investigate sulfur's wider potential as a formation history tracer by implementing the first multi-phase treatment of S in a planet population synthesis model. We present the planet formation module of \\textsc{sponchpop} and its first predicted planet growth tracks and populations. We explore the diversity of planet compositions in terms of their sulfur budget, including both refractory and volatile components, and apply a novel gas-grain conversion of sulfur to study how formation trajectories of giant planets relate to final core and envelope compositions. We show that planets inherit a wide range of core and envelope sulfur content related to accretion history while considering late-stage planetesimal infall, providing a new diagnostic tool for planet formation. The diverse sulfur content of planet cores suggests some rocky planets may be born sulfur-poor, with implications for their geochemistry and habitability. Enhanced sulfur abundances in gas-giant atmospheres can be attributed to formation beyond the H2S iceline, such as the giants in our Solar System.",

      "abstract": "Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations suggest that the disc of HD 163296 is being actively shaped by embedded, yet unseen protoplanets, as indicated by numerous gas and dust substructures consistent with planet-disc interaction models. We report the first detection of simple organic molecules, HCN and C2H, tracing a candidate circumplanetary disc (CPD) in the HD 163296 system, located at an orbital radius of $R=88\\pm7$ au and azimuth $φ=46\\pm3^\\circ$ (or $R=0.75''$, $\\rm{PA}=350^\\circ$ in projected sky coordinates), and originating near the midplane of the circumstellar disc. The signature is localised but spectrally resolved, and it overlaps with a previously reported planet candidate, P94, identified through kinematic perturbations traced by CO lines. We propose a scenario in which the observed chemical anomalies arise from increased heating driven by the forming planet and ongoing accretion through its CPD, facilitating the thermal desorption of species that would otherwise remain frozen out in the disc midplane, and potentially triggering the activation barriers of chemical reactions that lead to enhanced molecular production. Based on a first-order dynamical analysis of the HCN spectrum from the CPD--isolated with a 7$σ$ significance--we infer an upper limit on the planet mass of 1.8 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, consistent with predictions from CO kinematics and constraints from direct imaging studies. By comparing the CPD sizes derived from our models with theoretical expectations where the CPD radius corresponds to roughly one-third of the planet's Hill radius, we favor CPD gas temperatures $T > 150$ K, planet masses $M_{\\rm p} < 1.0$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$, and CPD radii $R_{\\rm CPD} < 2$ au.",

      "abstract": "The structure and evolution of close-in exoplanets are shaped by atmospheric loss and migration processes, which give rise to key population features such as the hot Neptune desert, ridge, and savanna - regions of the period-radius space whose boundaries offer critical insights into planetary formation and survival. As part of the KESPRINT collaboration, we selected the TESS transiting planet candidate TOI-3862.01 for radial velocity follow-up to confirm its planetary nature and characterize its mass and bulk properties. This planet candidate is of particular interest due to its position in the middle of the hot Neptune desert, making it a valuable probe for testing theories of planet migration and atmospheric loss. We confirmed the planetary nature and determined the mass of TOI-3862.01 (hereinafter TOI-3862b) by performing a joint fit with both transit and radial velocity data, precisely characterizing the bulk properties of this planet. TOI-3862b is a super-Neptune on a 1.56-day orbit around a Sun-like star with an effective temperature of 5300$\\pm$50K. It has a mass of 53.7$_{-2.9}^{+2.8}$ M$_{\\oplus}$ and a radius of 5.53$\\pm$0.18 R$_{\\oplus}$, corresponding to a density of 1.7$\\pm$0.2 g/cm^3. This places it among the rare population of hot and dense super-Neptune desert planets. TOI-3862b, residing deep in the hot Neptune desert, represents a rare occurrence in an otherwise sparsely populated region, offering a valuable opportunity to probe the processes that may allow planets to survive in such environments.",

      "abstract": "Past studies have revealed the dependency of the disc parameters (mass, radius, viscosity, grain fragmentation velocity, dust-to-gas ratio) on the formation of giant planets, where more massive discs seem beneficial for giant planet formation. It is unclear how the different disc properties influence the composition of forming giant planets. The idea that the atmospheric abundances can trace directly the formation location of planets is put into question, due to the chemical evolution of the disc, caused by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles. This complicates the idea of a relation between atmospheric abundances and planet formation locations. We use planet formation simulations that include the effects of pebble drift and evaporation and investigate how the different disc parameters influence the atmospheric composition of giant planets. We focus on the atmospheric C/O, C/H, O/H and S/H ratios allowing us to probe tracers for volatiles and refractories and thus different accretion pathways of giant planets. We find that most of the disc parameters have only a limited influence on the atmospheric abundances of gas giants, except for the dust-to-gas ratio, where a larger value results in higher atmospheric abundances. However the atmospheric abundances are determined by the planetary formation location, even in the pebble drift and evaporation scenario. Our study suggests that volatile-rich giant exoplanets predominantly form in the inner disc regions, where they can accrete large fractions of vapour-enhanced gas. Our study shows that simulations that try to trace the origin of giant planets via their atmospheric abundances do not have to probe all disc parameters, as long as the disc parameters allow the formation of giant planets. Our study thus suggests that the diversity of observed planetary compositions is a direct consequence of their formation location and migration history.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nWhen we look up at the night sky, we're seeing just a tiny fraction of the planets that exist in our galaxy. Scientists have discovered thousands of exoplanets—worlds orbiting other stars—and many are giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. But here's the fascinating puzzle: these distant worlds have wildly different atmospheric compositions, even when they're similar in size. Some are rich in carbon, others in oxygen, and still others contain surprising amounts of sulfur. Understanding why planets turn out so different helps us piece together the story of how planetary systems form, including our own. It also guides our search for worlds that might harbor life, since a planet's atmosphere largely determines whether it could support the chemistry of living things.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers created detailed computer simulations to watch giant planets form from scratch. Think of a planetary system's birth like a cosmic construction site: there's a spinning disk of gas and dust around a young star, and within this disk, planets slowly assemble themselves. The team focused on tiny particles called pebbles—cosmic dust grains that drift inward toward the star, picking up and releasing different chemical ingredients as they travel. As these pebbles encounter temperature changes, they evaporate and enrich the surrounding gas with various elements. The scientists then tracked how forming giant planets gobble up this chemically-evolving gas, testing different starting conditions for their cosmic construction sites to see how each scenario affected the final planetary recipes.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe study revealed that most factors affecting planet formation—like how massive or viscous the initial disk is—barely influence what ends up in a giant planet's atmosphere. However, one factor made a huge difference: the amount of dust compared to gas in the original disk. More dust means richer planetary atmospheres. Surprisingly, even though the disk's chemistry constantly changes as material moves around, a planet's location during formation still acts like its postal code—planets forming closer to their star end up with more volatile-rich atmospheres because they can feast on gas that's been enriched by evaporating materials.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThese findings simplify the detective work of tracing exoplanets back to their origins. Scientists studying distant worlds through their atmospheric fingerprints now know they don't need to worry about every possible formation scenario—location is king.

      "summary_html": "<h4>Why It Matters</h4>\n<p>When we look up at the night sky, we're seeing just a tiny fraction of the planets that exist in our galaxy. Scientists have discovered thousands of exoplanets—worlds orbiting other stars—and many are giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. But here's the fascinating puzzle: these distant worlds have wildly different atmospheric compositions, even when they're similar in size. Some are rich in carbon, others in oxygen, and still others contain surprising amounts of sulfur. Understanding why planets turn out so different helps us piece together the story of how planetary systems form, including our own. It also guides our search for worlds that might harbor life, since a planet's atmosphere largely determines whether it could support the chemistry of living things.</p>\n<h4>What They Did</h4>\n<p>The researchers created detailed computer simulations to watch giant planets form from scratch. Think of a planetary system's birth like a cosmic construction site: there's a spinning disk of gas and dust around a young star, and within this disk, planets slowly assemble themselves. The team focused on tiny particles called pebbles—cosmic dust grains that drift inward toward the star, picking up and releasing different chemical ingredients as they travel. As these pebbles encounter temperature changes, they evaporate and enrich the surrounding gas with various elements. The scientists then tracked how forming giant planets gobble up this chemically-evolving gas, testing different starting conditions for their cosmic construction sites to see how each scenario affected the final planetary recipes.</p>\n<h4>Key Findings</h4>\n<p>The study revealed that most factors affecting planet formation—like how massive or viscous the initial disk is—barely influence what ends up in a giant planet's atmosphere. However, one factor made a huge difference: the amount of dust compared to gas in the original disk. More dust means richer planetary atmospheres. Surprisingly, even though the disk's chemistry constantly changes as material moves around, a planet's location during formation still acts like its postal code—planets forming closer to their star end up with more volatile-rich atmospheres because they can feast on gas that's been enriched by evaporating materials.</p>\n<h4>Looking Forward</h4>\n<p>These findings simplify the detective work of tracing exoplanets back to their origins. Scientists studying distant worlds through their atmospheric fingerprints now know they don't need to worry about every possible formation scenario—location is king. This research suggests that the incredible diversity we observe in exoplanet atmospheres isn't random but tells a coherent story of where and how these worlds formed. As next-generation telescopes come online, astronomers will be able to analyze many more exoplanet atmospheres, using these insights to map out the formation histories of entire planetary systems and better understand the cosmic processes that create worlds like our own.</p>",

      "abstract": "The Galaxy's most common known planetary systems have several Earth-to-Neptune-size planets in compact orbits. At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii). The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5-4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance.",

      "abstract": "Mean motion resonances (MMRs) are a key phenomenon in orbital dynamics. The traditional disturbing function expansion in celestial mechanics shows that, at low eccentricities, $p$:$p-q$ MMRs exhibit a clear hierarchy of strengths, scaling as $e^q$, where $q$ is the order of the resonance. This explains why first-order MMRs (e.g., 3:2 and 4:3) are important, while the infinite number of higher order integer ratios are not. However, this relationship derived from a technical perturbation series expansion provides little physical intuition. In this paper, we provide a simple physical explanation of this result for closely spaced orbits. In this limit, interplanetary interactions are negligible except during close encounters at conjunction, where the planets impart a gravitational \"kick\" to each other's mean motion. We show that while first-order MMRs involve a single conjunction before the configuration repeats, higher order MMRs involve multiple conjunctions per cycle, whose effects cancel out more precisely the higher the order of the resonance. Starting from the effects of a single conjunction, we provide an alternate, physically motivated derivation of MMRs' $e^q$ strength scaling.",

      "abstract": "ASTRA is a Python package that provides a modular, instrument-independent interface for working with high-resolution stellar spectra. Designed to support data from multiple spectrographs, including ESPRESSO (Pepe et al., 2021), HARPS (Mayor et al., 2003; Pepe et al., 2002), MAROON-X (Seifahrt et al., 2022), and CARMENES (Quirrenbach et al., 2014). ASTRA offers a unified abstraction over their data formats, enabling consistent access to fluxes, wavelengths, uncertainties, and metadata across instruments. Furthermore, it applies the necessary wavelength and flux calibrations that are needed, as described by the official pipelines of each instrument.",

      "title": "Reinforcement Learning to Discover a NorthEast Monsoon Index for Monthly Rainfall Prediction in Thailand",
      "abstract": "Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.",
