      "title": "Habitable Zones Around Massive Stars: From the Main Sequence to Supergiants",
      "abstract": "Massive stars dominate the radiative and mechanical feedback of young stellar populations, yet their intense ultraviolet fields and strong winds are typically presumed to preclude Earth-like habitability. We quantify this expectation by mapping time dependent habitable zones (HZs) for solar-metallicity stars with initial masses of 0.8-120\\,M_☉. From rotating and non-rotating GENEC tracks we derive bolometric ``climate'' HZ boundaries and enforce XUV energy-limited escape and wind ram-pressure retention constraints for a dipole-magnetized Earth analogue. The operational inner edge is set by the most restrictive limit, and we measure the annulus lifetime, the longest continuous residence at fixed orbit, and the maximum number of dynamically packed terrestrial planets it can host. We find a sharp main-sequence ceiling: while a 9\\,M_☉ star sustains an operational HZ for 30 Myr at 70-130 AU, the main-sequence annulus becomes brief and extremely narrow by 12\\,M_☉ and disappears by 15\\,M_☉. Post main-sequence evolution can reopen HZs up to 25-30\\,M_☉, but only for 0.03-1.5 Myr at hundreds to 10³ AU, disappearing by 40\\,M_☉. Rotation modestly increases habitable lifetimes near the upper main sequence without altering the high mass ceiling. Initial Mass Function (IMF) weighting shows that massive stars contribute only 10⁻⁴ of the habitable planet-time budget. Even so, they still add of order a few 10⁵ operationally habitable Earth analogues to the Milky Way at any instant. This implies that massive star systems are unlikely to dominate the Galaxy wide habitability budget, but they may still provide a set of short-lived, observationally distinct targets for biosignature searches.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nWhen we think about planets that could support life, we usually focus on stars like our Sun. But what about the universe's most massive, brilliant stars—the stellar giants that burn thousands of times brighter? These cosmic powerhouses have largely been written off as too violent and short-lived to nurture life. This new research challenges that assumption, asking a fascinating question: could these stellar behemoths actually host habitable worlds, even if only briefly? The answer could reshape how we search for life in the galaxy and reveal entirely new categories of potentially habitable planets we've never seriously considered.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers created detailed computer models tracking the life cycles of stars ranging from slightly smaller than our Sun to monsters 120 times more massive. For each star, they calculated where the \"habitable zone\"—the orbital sweet spot where liquid water could exist—would be located throughout the star's lifetime. Think of it like mapping where you'd need to stand around different campfires to stay comfortably warm as they burn and change over time. They also factored in the harsh realities of massive stars: their intense ultraviolet radiation that can strip away planetary atmospheres, and their powerful stellar winds that can literally blow atmospheres into space.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe results reveal a cosmic trade-off. A star nine times our Sun's mass can maintain a habitable zone for 30 million years, but you'd need to be much farther away—70 to 130 times Earth's distance from the Sun. Stars 15 times more massive than our Sun can't sustain habitable zones at all during their main lifetime. However, there's a twist: when these giants enter their final phases, habitable zones can briefly reappear for up to 1.5 million years, though at enormous distances. While massive stars contribute less than 0.01% of the galaxy's total \"habitable time,\" they still could host around 100,000 potentially habitable Earth-like worlds right now.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThis research opens an intriguing new frontier for planet hunters. While these massive star systems won't dominate our search for life, they offer a unique opportunity to study how life might emerge and evolve under extreme conditions and accelerated timescales.

      "title": "The Interplanetary Habitable Zone",
      "abstract": "The concept of a system-wide measure of the sustainment of life (habitability) for space-faring interplanetary species is introduced and explored. Although largely agnostic to the details of how interplanetary life might operate (e.g., via technology or by utilizing organism traits that are, as of now, unknown to us), some assumptions must be made about energy harvesting, orbital mobility costs, radiation risks, and resource requirements. A multi-modal figure of merit is developed for evaluating an interplanetary habitable zone (IHZ). An agent-based model is also developed to simulate the dispersal of interplanetary life in a planetary system and characterize the IHZ. For the solar system, resource weightings between planetary bodies dictate many overall behaviors, including the sequence of migration from Earth to the Moon, Mars, and asteroid belt. Comparisons with the Trappist-1 exoplanetary system also point to critical sensitivities in the balance between resource availability and risk or cost factors (e.g., radiation risks and orbital Delta-v costs) that determine the structure of an IHZ. Results suggest that our solar system may have an inherent, and significant, advantage for a space-faring species over a system like Trappist-1. This modeling approach may also have application to emerging space economies in our own solar system.",

      "title": "Infrared spectra of methane-containing ice mixtures for JWST data analysis",
      "abstract": "Context. Solid methane (CH₄) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on low-temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited. Aims. We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation. Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted χ² minimization is used for the fitting. Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH₄:H₂O,CH₄:CO₂, CH₄:CH₃OH, CH₄:NH₃ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also test the usability of the spectra on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II. Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H₂O environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra, publicly available on Zenodo, can be used for fitting JWST data.",

      "title": "Atmospheric constraints on GJ 1214 b from CRIRES+ and prospects for characterisation with ANDES",
      "abstract": "In this study, we aim to constrain the atmospheric composition of GJ 1214 b using all available transits observed with the upgraded CRIRES+ spectrograph at the VLT by searching for the signatures of water vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide. We analysed eight CRIRES+ transit datasets covering the K band (1.90-2.45 microns) at a resolving power of R 100,000. We used the SysRem algorithm to correct for telluric and stellar contributions and employed the cross-correlation technique with templates from petitRADTRANS to search for H2O, CH4, and CO2. Injection-recovery tests across a grid of metallicities (Z) and cloud-deck pressures (pc) were performed to quantify detection limits. We also generated predictions for ANDES observations using end-to-end simulated datasets with EXoPLORE. We detect no significant H2O, CH4, or CO2 signatures. Injection-recovery tests show that such non-detections exclude atmospheres with low-altitude clouds and moderate or low metallicities. CH4 yields the tightest empirical limits, with CO2 unexpectedly ruling out intermediate metallicities ( 100xsolar) with clouds deeper due to its rapidly rising opacity in compressed, high-Z atmospheres. Our constraints are in line with either a high-Z or a high-altitude aerosol layer, in agreement with recent JWST inferences. The combined analysis of eight CRIRES+ datasets provides the most stringent high-resolution constraints on the atmospheric properties of GJ 1214 b to date. Simulations of a single transit observed with ANDES on the ELT predict modest improvements for H2O, a substantially expanded detectable region for CH4, and the strongest gains for CO2, making the latter a particularly effective tracer for characterising high-metallicity atmospheres in sub-Neptunes.",

After we removed the hot Jupiters, the planet types and their fractional numbers were similar for the multis and singles hosted by FGK-type stars. Furthermore, the median radii of both the singles and the multis increase with host star temperature already from late- to early-type M dwarfs and further up to F stars. Our analyses show that the singles are larger on average than the multis in our F, G, K, and M samples. However, after we excluded the hot Jupiters, the radius distributions of the singles and multis orbiting FGK stars are statistically indistinguishable, particularly at R < 4\\, R_⊕. In the FGK sample, we also identified an unexpected and significant overabundance of multis, compared to singles, at radii of ≈1.4-1.6\\, R_⊕. For the early- and late-type M samples, our work indicates that the multis are smaller on average than the singles and that the radius distributions of the multis and singles are different, except for the planets with R < 4\\, R_⊕ hosted by early-type M dwarfs. Nevertheless, these results for the two M samples are inconclusive because the sample sizes of 167 and 101 planets are limited. In conclusion, our analyses reveal that the singles and multis, excluding the hot Jupiters, orbiting FGK stars are overall consistent with originating from the same underlying population based on their planet types and radii. This interpretation is, however, not applicable within the region of the overabundance of multis identified in this work.",

      "abstract": "Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are key targets in the search for habitability due to the potential presence of subsurface oceans. Detecting complex organic molecules (COMs), essential for prebiotic chemistry, is crucial to assessing their potential. Though COMs remain undetected on these moons, ESA's JUICE and NASA's Europa Clipper missions aim to fill this gap with their science payloads. This study explores the formation and transport of COMs within Jupiter's circumplanetary disk (CPD), a critical environment for the formation of the Galilean moons. Using a time-dependent model that couples the evolving CPD structure with the dynamics of icy particles of varying sizes and release times, we assess two primary COM formation pathways: thermal processing of ices and UV photochemistry. The results indicate that heating, particularly of NH3:CO2 ices, occurs efficiently before substantial irradiation, making it the dominant pathway for COM formation in the Jovian CPD. However, the relative efficiencies of these two processes are governed by particle density, disk viscosity, accretion rate, and UV flux, which collectively determine drift timescales and exposure to favorable thermodynamic environments. Existing models indicate that Europa's accretion was relatively cold and prolonged, possibly allowing some COMs to survive incorporation, whereas Ganymede and Callisto likely formed under even cooler conditions conducive to preserving COM-rich material. These results highlight the potential inheritance of complex organics by the Galilean moons and offer a framework for interpreting upcoming compositional data from JUICE and Europa Clipper.",

      "abstract": "The observations of protostellar systems show a transition in the radial profile of specific angular momentum (and rotational velocity), evolving from j constant (v_φ r⁻¹) in the infalling-rotating envelope to j r¹/² (v_φ r⁻¹/²) in the Keplerian disk. We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the j-r profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed (vr) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and j begins a transition from j constant toward j r¹/². Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius (r CR) is defined where v_φ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of r CR, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier (r CB) where vr drops to negligible values. Inside r CB, a net negative gravitational torque drives mass accretion onto the protostar. On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed j-r profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed j-r jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ. Our results offer insights into the observable imprint of angular momentum redistribution mechanisms during star-disk formation.",

While several candidate chromophores have been proposed, no clear conclusions have been reached regarding its nature, evolution, or relationship to atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we perform microphysical simulations of the reddish haze over the GRS and quantify the production rates and timescales required to sustain it. Matching the previously reported chromophore column mass and effective radius in the GRS requires column-integrated injection fluxes in the range 1×10⁻¹²-7×10⁻¹² kg m⁻² s⁻¹, under low upwelling velocities in the upper troposphere (vₐthrmtrₒₚ 1.5×10⁻⁴ m s⁻¹) and particle charges of at least 20 electrons per μm. Such rates exceed the mass flux that standard photochemical models of Jupiter currently supply via NH₃-C₂H₂ photochemistry at 0.1-0.2 bar, the most popular chromophore pathway in recent literature. We find a lower limit of 7 years on the haze formation time. We also assess commonly used size and vertical distribution parameterisations for the chromophore haze, finding that eddy diffusion prevents the long-term confinement of a thin layer and that the extinction is dominated by particles that can be represented by a single log-normal size distribution.",
