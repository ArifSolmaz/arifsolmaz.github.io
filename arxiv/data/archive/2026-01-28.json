      "title": "A Cool Earth-sized Planet Candidate Transiting a Tenth Magnitude K-dwarf From K2",
      "abstract": "The transit method is currently one of our best means for the detection of potentially habitable \"Earth-like\" exoplanets. In principle, given sufficiently high photometric precision, cool Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars could be discovered via single transit detections; however, this has not previously been achieved. In this work, we report a 10-hour long single transit event which occurred on the V=10.1 K-dwarf HD 137010 during K2 Campaign 15 in 2017. The transit is comparatively shallow (225±10 ppm), but is detected at high signal-to-noise thanks to the exceptionally high photometric precision achieved for the target. Our analysis of the K2 photometry, historical and new imaging observations, and archival radial velocities and astrometry strongly indicate that the event was astrophysical, occurred on-target, and can be best explained by a transiting planet candidate, which we designate HD 137010 b. The single observed transit implies a radius of 1.06 (+0.06/-0.05) R_⊕, and assuming negligible orbital eccentricity we estimate an orbital period of 355 (+200/-59) days (a=0.88 (+0.32/-0.10) AU), properties comparable to Earth. We project an incident flux of 0.29 (+0.11/-0.13) I_⊕, which would place HD 137010 b near the outer edge of the habitable zone. This is the first planet candidate with Earth-like radius and orbital properties that transits a Sun-like star bright enough for substantial follow-up observations.",

      "title": "Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Planetary Systems through Population-Level, Large-Scale Surveys",
      "abstract": "Over the past three decades, exoplanet research has delivered an extensive census of planets spanning a wide range of masses, sizes, and orbital configurations. Despite this progress, the physical interpretation of these populations remains severely limited, as precise constraints on planetary masses, interior structures, and atmospheres are available only for a small, highly selected subset of targets. As a result, most known exoplanets remain physically ambiguous, preventing the construction of robust population-level trends and limiting our understanding of planet formation, evolution, and habitability. In the coming decades, missions such as PLATO, Earth 2.0, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will dramatically expand the number of exoplanets detected. However, without a corresponding capability to characterise planetary masses and atmospheres at scale, these discoveries will remain largely detection-driven. Current and planned facilities, including JWST and ELT-class instruments, excel at detailed studies of individual systems but are intrinsically unsuited for large, homogeneous surveys. This white paper identifies population-level physical characterisation as a fundamental science challenge for the 2040s and motivates the need for a new observational paradigm. We outline how photonics-enabled, modular telescope architectures can deliver the survey speed, stability, and scalability required to jointly probe planetary interiors and atmospheres across statistically meaningful samples, thereby enabling a comprehensive and physically grounded understanding of planetary systems.",

      "title": "Evidence for a Peak at ~0.3 in the Eccentricity Distribution of Typical Super-Jovian Exoplanets",
      "abstract": "In this study, we compute completeness-corrected occurrence rates of giant exoplanets as a function of mass, semimajor axis, and eccentricity, using the approximately uniform California Legacy Survey sample of RV-discovered planets published in Rosenthal et al. 2021. We recover the previously-detected rise in occurrence with semimajor axis for both lower- and higher-mass subsets of the population out to ~5 au. When restricting to planets with semimajor axes between 0.1 and 4.5 au (roughly speaking, the \"peak\" of giant planet occurrence), we find evidence for distinct eccentricity distributions for each of two mass sub-populations. Most strikingly, we observe a peak in the eccentricity distribution of super-Jovian planets (3-20~M_(J)) at 0.3, which is apparent using two different parameterizations of the eccentricity distribution model. A hierarchical histogram model reveals that ~92% of posterior samples indicate an elevated occurrence rate of super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities (0.2-0.4) compared to lower or higher eccentricities (i.e. evidence for a moderate eccentricity \"peak\"), and 99% of samples indicate super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities are more common than those with lower eccentricities (i.e. evidence that moderate eccentricities are more common than low eccentricities). We use a truncated Gaussian model fit to pinpoint the location of the super-Jupiter eccentricity peak with more precision, finding a maximum a posterior (MAP) peak location of e=0.3. This low but elevated characteristic eccentricity could be the result of dynamically hot histories, perhaps involving a giant impacts phase. All analysis code for this project is publicly available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/18089157) and GitHub (github.com/sblunt/eccentricities).",
