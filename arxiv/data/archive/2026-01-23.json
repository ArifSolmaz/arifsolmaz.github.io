      "title": "Modeling the Impact of Unresolved Stellar Companions on Detection Sensitivity in Kepler's Small Planet Occurrence Rates",
      "abstract": "Unresolved stellar companions can cause both under-estimations in the radii of transiting planets and over-estimations of their detectability, affecting our ability to reliably measure planet occurrence rates. To quantify the latter, we identified a control sample of 198 Kepler stars with sensitivity to Earth-like planets if they were single stars, and imaged them with adaptive optics. In 20% of systems, we detected stellar companions that were close enough to go unresolved in Kepler observations. We calculated the distribution of planet radius correction factors needed to adjust for these observed companions, along with simulations of undetected companions to which our observations were not sensitive. We then used these correction factors to optimize an occurrence rate model for small close-in planets while correcting Kepler's detection efficiency for the presence of unresolved companions, and quantified how this correction affects occurrence estimates. Median occurrence rates for small planets between 2-100 days increased by an average factor of 1.08-1.19 (depending on statistical treatments), with the largest differences found for smaller planets at larger orbital periods. We found that the frequency of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone (η_⊕) increased by a factor of 1.18 (+0.43/-0.66)-1.46 (+0.53/-0.83) when accounting for the effect of unresolved companions on Kepler's detection sensitivity.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nFor decades, astronomers have been trying to answer one of humanity's most profound questions: How common are Earth-like planets that could potentially harbor life? NASA's Kepler Space Telescope revolutionized this search by discovering thousands of planets orbiting distant stars. But there's been a hidden problem affecting our cosmic census—many stars that appear single actually have companion stars lurking nearby, invisible to Kepler's eyes. This stellar hide-and-seek has been quietly skewing our calculations about how many Earth-sized worlds exist in the \"Goldilocks zone\" where liquid water could survive. Getting these numbers right isn't just academic—it helps us understand whether Earth-like worlds are cosmic rarities or surprisingly common neighbors.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe research team tackled this problem like cosmic detectives. They selected 198 stars from Kepler's catalog—stars that should be sensitive enough to spot Earth-like planets if they were truly alone in space. Then, using powerful ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics (technology that removes atmospheric blur, like cosmic glasses), they took ultra-sharp images of each star. This technique can reveal companion stars that Kepler couldn't distinguish from the main star because they appear too close together. Think of it like using a magnifying glass to discover that what looked like one distant streetlight is actually two lights standing side by side. The team then ran computer simulations to account for even fainter companions their instruments couldn't detect, creating a complete picture of stellar multiplicity.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe results were eye-opening: one in five stars (20%) had hidden companions close enough to fool Kepler. These unseen stellar sidekicks were systematically throwing off planet measurements in two ways—making planets appear smaller than they actually are and making Kepler think it should have spotted planets more easily than it actually could. When the researchers corrected for these effects, they found that small planets are more common than previously thought. Most significantly, their calculations suggest Earth-sized planets in habitable zones are 18% to 46% more frequent than earlier estimates indicated.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThis discovery means the universe might be more planet-rich than we realized, particularly for worlds resembling our own. As next-generation telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope begin studying planetary atmospheres, these refined occurrence rates will help astronomers better target their searches for potentially habitable worlds.

      "title": "Hot and cloudy: High temperature clouds in super-Earths and sub-Neptunes",
      "abstract": "JWST observations provide for the first time evidence for an atmosphere on a rocky exoplanet - 55 Cnc e. The atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is hot with T_(eq)>2000K and shows strong variability, for which cloud formation above a molten crust could be one possible explanation. The composition of the atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is still unknown but suggests the presence of volatiles. We have run cloud formation models on a grid of N-dominated, O-dominated, C-dominated and H-dominated atmospheres to investigate which type of cloud we could expect on hot super-Earths and hot sub-Neptunes (1000K < T < 3000K). Our models combine radiative transfer with equilibrium chemistry of the gaseous and condensed phases, vertical mixing of condensable species, sedimentation, nucleation and coagulation. We find that the condensability of species is highly dependent on the oxygen abundance of an atmosphere. Oxygen poor atmospheres can be heated by UV and optical absorbers PS, TiO and CN which create temperature inversions. These inhibit condensation. Oxygen rich atmospheres are colder without temperature inversions, and are therefore more favourable environments for cloud formation. The major expected cloud component in O-dominated atmospheres with solar refractory abundance is TiO_2(s). Spectral features of clouds in these worlds are stronger in transmission than in emission, in particular at short wavelengths. We find a lack of optical data of solid species in comparison to the variety of stable cloud components which can form on hot, rocky planets.",

      "title": "Evidence for stellar contamination and water absorption in NGTS-5b's transmission spectra with GTC/OSIRIS",
      "abstract": "Transmission spectroscopy serves as a valuable tool for probing atmospheric absorption features in the terminator regions of exoplanets. Stellar surface heterogeneity can introduce wavelength-dependent contamination that complicates the interpretation of planetary spectra. We aim to investigate the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn NGTS-5b through optical transmission spectroscopy. Two transits were observed with the low-resolution Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Chromatic transit light curves were modeled to derive optical transmission spectra and multiple Bayesian spectral retrievals were performed to characterize the atmospheric properties. Model comparisons provide strong evidence for contamination from unocculted stellar spots. A joint retrieval of the transmission spectra, assuming equilibrium chemistry, indicates a relatively clear atmosphere with a sub-solar C/O ratio of <0.22 (90% upper limit) and a low metallicity of 0.10 (+0.34/-0.05) × solar. Retrievals assuming free chemistry yield strong evidence for the presence of H_2O, with its abundance constrained to X_(H_2O) = -0.79 (+0.14/-0.17). However, the abundances of other species remain unconstrained due to the limited optical wavelength coverage. The discrepancies between the two NGTS-5b transit spectra can be attributed to varying levels of stellar contamination. NGTS-5b thus appears to host a relatively clear, water-rich atmosphere, pending confirmation from additional observations of molecular bands in the infrared.",
