      "title": "Atmospheric characterization of HIP 67522 b with VLT/CRIRES+. VLT/CRIRES+ suggests a heavier planet and hints at deuterium fractionation",
      "abstract": "Young transiting exoplanets provide unique opportunities to probe planetary atmospheres during the critical early phases of evolution. HIP 67522 b, a 17 Myr old hot Jupiter with an extraordinarily low bulk density, represents an ideal target for high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We aim to characterize the atmospheric composition, thermal structure, and dynamics of HIP 67522 b using ground-based high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy. We obtained high-resolution spectra with VLT/CRIRES+ in the K2166 band during a transit on 30 January 2025. We applied cross-correlation techniques and Bayesian nested sampling retrievals to constrain molecular abundances, temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics. We detect H₂O at 20σ and CO at 5σ, confirming the extremely extended atmosphere of this low-mass giant. A velocity offset of -2.9 ± 0.2 km s⁻¹ indicates day-to-night winds. The rotation velocity is constrained to <1.8 km s⁻¹ at 3σ, consistent with tidal locking. Retrieval analysis suggests a planetary mass of 29.8 ± 3 Earth masses and a vertically isothermal atmosphere. This mass is two times larger than the mass estimated from JWST atmospheric observations and inconsistent at 3σ hence leaving a doubt on the actual planetary density of the planet. Using the mass derived derived from the CRIRES+ data, we derive a C/O ratio of 0.83 ± 0.09, about 1.5 times solar, and a subsolar metallicity [C+O/H] = -0.8 ± 0.4 which can be increased if the atmosphere is cloudy, a degeneracy our data alone cannot resolve. We report a tentative 2σ detection of HDO with an extreme enrichment factor of 1000 relative to the protosolar D/H ratio. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of deuterium in an exoplanet atmosphere and would require intense escape rate to be explained.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nImagine catching a planet in its cosmic infancy—that's exactly what astronomers have done with HIP 67522 b, a \"baby\" Jupiter that's only 17 million years old. In cosmic terms, this planet is practically a newborn, giving scientists a rare window into how giant planets evolve during their most dramatic early years. What makes this discovery especially intriguing is that this young world appears to be a cosmic oddball: it's incredibly puffy, with a density so low it would float on water like a beach ball. Understanding planets like this helps us piece together the story of how planetary systems—including our own—formed and changed over billions of years.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe research team used the Very Large Telescope in Chile, equipped with an ultra-sensitive instrument called CRIRES+, to analyze starlight filtering through the planet's atmosphere as it passed in front of its host star. Think of it like studying a shadow puppet show—as the planet blocks some of the star's light, different molecules in its atmosphere absorb specific colors, creating a unique fingerprint. The astronomers collected this light and broke it down into its component colors with incredible precision, then used computer models to decode what those patterns reveal about the planet's atmospheric makeup, temperature, and even its winds.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe team made several groundbreaking discoveries. They detected water vapor with extraordinary confidence and found carbon monoxide as well, confirming this planet has an extremely extended, puffy atmosphere. Surprisingly, their analysis suggests the planet is actually twice as heavy as previously thought—about 30 times Earth's mass instead of 15. They discovered winds blowing at nearly 3 kilometers per second from the planet's day side to its night side. Most remarkably, they found tentative evidence of \"heavy water\" containing deuterium, which would be the first time this has been detected in any exoplanet atmosphere.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThis research opens exciting new frontiers in exoplanet science. The possible deuterium detection, if confirmed, could revolutionize our understanding of how planets lose their atmospheres over time. The conflicting mass measurements highlight how much we still have to learn about these distant worlds, promising that future observations will continue surprising us and reshaping our cosmic perspective.",

      "title": "The ESO SupJup Survey IX: Isotopic evidence of a recent formation for Luhman 16AB",
      "abstract": "The distinct formation pathways of directly-imaged exoplanets and isolated brown dwarfs might leave imprints in the inherited elemental and isotopic abundances, but such measurements require careful characterisation of the atmospheres. In particular, L-T transition objects exhibit signs of dynamics that drive their atmospheres out of chemical equilibrium. In this work, we studied the nearest L-T brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A and B, to assess the chemical dis-equilibrium in their atmospheres and to investigate their elemental and isotopic composition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we obtained high-resolution CRIRES^+ K-band spectra of the binary, which were analysed using an atmospheric retrieval framework. We detect and retrieve the abundances of ¹²CO, H₂O, CH₄, NH₃, H₂S, HF, and the ¹³CO isotopologue. Both atmospheres are in chemical dis-equilibrium with somewhat stronger vertical mixing in Luhman 16A compared to B (K_zz,A 10⁸.⁷, K_zz,B 10⁸.²\\ cm²\\ s⁻¹). The tested chemical models, free- and dis-equilibrium chemistry, yield consistent mixing ratios and agree with earlier work at shorter wavelengths. The gaseous C/O ratios show evidence of oxygen trapping in silicate-oxide clouds. While the C/O ratios are consistent with solar, the metallicities are modestly enhanced with [C/H] 0.15. The carbon isotope ratios are measured at ¹²C/¹³C_A=74⁺²₋₂ and ¹²C/¹³C_B=74⁺³₋₃. The coincident constraints of metallicities and isotopes across the binary reinforce their likely shared formation. The ¹²C/¹³C ratios are aligned with the present-day interstellar medium, but lower than the solar-system value. This suggests a recent inheritance and corroborates the relatively young age ( 500 Myr) of Luhman 16AB as members of the Oceanus moving group.",

      "title": "Visual inspection of potential exocomet transits identified through machine learning and statistical methods",
      "abstract": "In this work, we explore several ways to detect possible exocomet transits in the TESS (The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) light curves. The first one has been presented in our previous work, a machine learning approach based on the Random Forest algorithm. It was trained on asymmetric transit profiles calculated as a result of the modelling of a comet transit, and then applied to real star light curves from Sector 1 of TESS. This allowed us to detect 32 candidates with weak and non-periodic brightness dips that may correspond to comet-like events. The aim of this work is to analyse the events identified by the visual inspection to make sure that the features detected were not caused by instrumental effects. The second approach to detect possible exocomet transits, which is proposed, is an independent statistical method to test the results of the machine learning algorithm and to look for asymmetric minima directly in the light curves. This approach was applied to eta Pictoris light curves using TESS data from Sectors 5, 6, 32, and 33. The algorithm reproduced nearly all previously known events deeper than 0.03 % of the star flux, showing that it is efficient to detect shallow and irregular flux changes in the different sectors of the TESS data and at the different levels of noise. The combination of machine learning, visual inspection, and statistical analysis facilitates the identification of faint and short-lived asymmetric transits in photometric data. Although the number of confirmed exocomet transits is still small, the growing amount of observations points to their likely presence in many young planetary systems.",

      "abstract": "Understanding planetary habitability requires a comparative approach that explores the divergent evolutionary outcomes of Earth and Venus. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (``exoVenuses''). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO₂) and aerosol physics (H₂SO₄ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O₂/O₃ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2--0.4 μm, optical/NIR coverage to 1.5 μm, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3--1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features. Finally, we outline a community-driven path to producing robust demographic inferences and target selection for optimizing HWO observations.",

The researchers determined exactly what the telescope needs to accomplish this ambitious survey: it must be able to detect ultraviolet light and distinguish planets that are extremely close to their stars, sometimes just one-third the distance between Earth and the Sun. They also identified specific chemical signatures that would reveal whether a planet has gone down Venus's apocalyptic path.</p>\n<h4>Looking Forward</h4>\n<p>This research provides a roadmap for one of the most important questions in astronomy: what determines a planet's fate?

      "abstract": "Observations of ultra-hot Jupiters offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the physics of some of the most extreme planetary atmospheres known. With exceedingly high amounts of irradiation blasting their upper atmospheres, ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures comparable to some late type stars enabling refractory metals otherwise condensed in colder planets to exist in the gas phase, all the while still maintaining comparatively cool nightsides. The ensuing intense temperature contrasts can give rise not only to strong day-to-night winds, but also to vastly different chemical and cloud properties on opposing hemispheres. With its ability to resolve spectral features that are unique to individual chemical species, high resolution spectroscopy can unambiguously disentangle atmospheric signals of exoplanetary origin, which follow a well-defined Keplerian motion, from stationary or pseudo-stationary telluric and stellar lines. Combined, the high temperature of ultra-hot Jupiters providing access to refractory metals with narrow spectral features and the ability of high-resolution spectroscopy to resolve said narrow lines provides access to a wealth of information about these atmospheres that would otherwise be unavailable at lower resolving powers or for other types of planets. In this chapter we explore some of the key physical and chemical transitions that differentiate ultra-hot Jupiters from their colder counterparts and highlight the unique opportunities arising from probing their atmospheres using high resolution spectroscopy.",

      "abstract": "The most productive tracer of exoplanetary atmospheric escape is the measurement of excess absorption in the near-infrared metastable helium triplet during transits. Atmospheric escape of a close-in planet's atmosphere plays a role in its evolutionary pathway, but to which extent remains unknown. It could explain demographic features like the radius valley and Neptunian desert. We will describe the development of instrumental, reduction, and modelling techniques to study exoplanetary atmospheric escape, focusing on the helium triplet. One such development is the NIGHT spectrograph, intended to provide the first survey of escaping atmospheres. NIGHT spectra will be processed with ANTARESS, a state-of-the-art workflow for reducing high-resolution spectral time-series of exoplanet transits and computing transmission spectra in a robust and reproducible way. Transmission spectra contain the potential signature of the planetary atmosphere as well as distortions induced by the occultation of local regions of the stellar surface along the transit chord. Transmission spectra cannot be corrected for those stellar distortions without biasing the planetary signal. They must instead be directly interpreted using a numerical model like the EvE code, which generates realistic stellar spectra that account for the system's 3D architecture, the planet's atmospheric structure, and its local occultation of the stellar disc. This global approach, from the measurement and computation of transmission spectra to their interpretation, will be a legacy of the NCCR PlanetS, becoming the standard procedure to study high-resolution spectroscopy of planetary transits.",

      "abstract": "We present four newly validated transiting brown dwarfs identified through TESS photometry and confirmed with high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained from the FEROS and PLATOSpec spectrographs. Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits.",

      "abstract": "Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] M☉ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.",

The researchers found that up to 20% of sun-like stars may have already swallowed a hot Jupiter during their lifetime. They discovered that hot Jupiter populations split into two distinct groups: young systems where planets haven't had time to spiral inward, and older systems where many planets have already been consumed. The smoking gun comes from certain fast-spinning stars that likely gained their rotation from gobbling up planets, including specific examples like TOI-2458 and GJ 504.</p>\n<h4>Looking Forward</h4>\n<p>This research transforms our understanding of planetary system evolution from a static picture to a dynamic one where planets regularly meet fiery ends. It suggests that hot Jupiters represent survivors in a cosmic elimination game, with many of their siblings already lost to stellar appetites. Future telescopes may help us identify more \"guilty\" stars that bear the rotational signatures of their planetary meals.</p>",

      "abstract": "The current census of planetary systems displays a wide range of architectures. Extending earlier work, this paper investigates the correlation between our classification framework for these architectures and host stellar properties. Specifically, we explore how planetary system properties depend on stellar mass and stellar metallicity. This work confirms previously detected trends that jovian planets are less prevalent for low-mass and low-metallicity stars. We also find new, but expected trends such as that the total mass in planets increases with stellar mass, and that observed planetary system masses show an upper limit that is roughly consistent with expectations from the stability of circumstellar disks. We tentatively identify potential unique trends in the host stars of super-puffs and hot jupiters and a possible subdivision of the class of hot jupiter systems. In general, we find that system architectures are not overly dependent on host star properties.",

      "abstract": "Circumstellar discs, and especially their inner regions, covering ranges from <1 au to a few astronomical units, are the birthplaces of terrestrial planets. The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better χ²_r values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from 1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim R_rim≈0.1 au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc (r_out6 au) around the primary. The very close-in inner rim indicates the presence of material inside the typical wall-like sublimation radius R_rim,literature≈0.3 au. The complex, temporally variable inner-disc geometry is likely affected or even caused by the close passing ( 5 au) and short orbit (P≈24 yr) of the companion HD 142527 B.",

We generate a deep learning model, ExoDNN, which predicts the probability of a DR3 source to host unresolved companions based on those fit quality statistics. Applying the predictive capability of ExoDNN to a volume limited sample of F,G,K and M stars from Gaia DR3, we have produced a list of 7414 candidate stars hosting companions. The stellar properties of these candidates, such as their mass and metallicity, are similar to those of the Gaia DR3 non single star sample.
