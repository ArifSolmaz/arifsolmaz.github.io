      "title": "Most Hot Jupiters Were Cool Giant Planets for More Than 1 Gyr",
      "abstract": "The origin of hot Jupiters is the oldest problem in exoplanet astrophysics. Hot Jupiters formed in situ or via disk migration should be in place just a few Myr after the formation of their host stars. On the other hand, hot Jupiters formed via eccentricity excitation and tidal damping as a result of planet--planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations may take 1 Gyr or more to arrive at their observed locations. We propose that the relative ages of hot Jupiters inside, near, and outside the bias-corrected peak of the observed hot Jupiter period distribution can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. Though the lack of precise and accurate age inferences for isolated hot Jupiter host stars makes this test difficult to implement, comparisons between the Galactic velocity dispersions of the hot Jupiter subpopulations enable this investigation. To transform relative age offsets into absolute age offsets, we calibrate the monotonically increasing solar neighborhood age--velocity dispersion relation using an all-sky sample of subgiants with precise ages and a metallicity distribution matched to that of hot Jupiter hosts. We find that the inside-peak and near-peak subpopulations are older than the outside-peak subpopulation, with the inside-peak subpopulation slightly older than the near-peak subpopulation. We conclude that at least 40\\% but not more than 70\\% of the hot Jupiter population must have formed via a late-time, peak-populating process like high-eccentricity migration that typically occurs more than 1.5 Gyr after system formation.",

      "title": "A Theory of transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds: Spectral-line saturation and limits on mass-loss inference",
      "abstract": "Transmission spectroscopy is a key technique in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and has been widely applied to planets undergoing hydrodynamic escape. While a robust analytic theory exists for transmission spectra of hydrostatic atmospheres, the corresponding interpretation for escaping atmospheres has so far relied on numerical modeling. In this work, we develop a theory of transmission spectroscopy in hydrodynamically escaping atmospheres by coupling the standard transmission geometry to a steady-state, spherically symmetric, isothermal outflow. This approach yields closed-form expressions and allows the optical depth inversion problem to be examined. The analytic solution reveals that transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds naturally separates into two regimes. In an opacity-limited regime, transmission depths retain sensitivity to the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Beyond a critical threshold, however, spectral-line cores become saturated and no longer provide a unique constraint on the mass flux. This transition is marked by a sharp analytic boundary of the form σ(λ)× M C_(sat), where C_(sat) is a constant set by the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the wind. This condition specifies when the inversion between transmission depth and mass-loss rate admits a real solution. Once it is violated, the effective transit radius is no longer controlled by opacity or mass loss, but by the geometric extent of the absorbing wind. These results demonstrate that spectral-line saturation in transmission spectroscopy corresponds to a fundamental loss of invertibility between absorption and atmospheric mass loss, rather than a gradual weakening of sensitivity. The theory provides a physically transparent explanation for why strong transmission line cores often fail to constrain mass-loss rates, while weaker lines and line wings remain diagnostic.",

      "summary": "**Why It Matters**\n\nImagine trying to understand a distant world by studying the light that passes through its atmosphere as it crosses in front of its star. This technique, called transmission spectroscopy, has become our most powerful tool for learning what exoplanet atmospheres are made of and how they behave. Some planets are so hot that their atmospheres are literally boiling away into space—a dramatic process that could determine whether these worlds can retain any atmosphere at all. Understanding how much atmosphere these planets are losing is crucial for predicting their fate and finding worlds that might harbor life. Until now, scientists have struggled to accurately measure these atmospheric escape rates, often getting confusing or contradictory results from their observations.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers developed a mathematical theory to explain how light behaves when it passes through an atmosphere that's actively escaping into space. Think of it like trying to see through steam rising from a boiling pot—the moving gas affects how light travels through it. Previous studies relied on complex computer simulations to interpret these observations, but this team created simple equations that describe the physics directly. They modeled the escaping atmosphere as a steady wind flowing outward from the planet, then calculated how this wind would absorb starlight at different wavelengths. This approach allowed them to derive clear, mathematical relationships between what telescopes observe and the actual rate at which the planet loses its atmosphere.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe team discovered that atmospheric measurements fall into two distinct categories, separated by a sharp boundary. When atmospheric escape is moderate, telescopes can accurately measure how fast the planet is losing gas. But beyond a critical threshold, the absorption lines become \"saturated\"—like trying to see through fog so thick that adding more fog doesn't make it any more opaque. At this point, the observations no longer reveal the escape rate but instead just show the physical size of the escaping gas cloud. This explains why astronomers sometimes get reliable measurements from faint spectral features while stronger signals paradoxically provide no useful information about mass loss.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThis breakthrough provides astronomers with a roadmap for interpreting their observations more accurately. Instead of being puzzled by strong but uninformative signals, researchers now know to focus on weaker spectral lines that still retain sensitivity to atmospheric escape rates.

      "abstract": "I derive the statistical relationship between a radial velocity or astrometric acceleration (a trend), a companion's mass, and the projected separation of the companion. These relationships, expressed as probability density functions, are analytic and independent of all Keplerian orbital elements so long as orbits are randomly oriented in space. I also derive a closed-form expression for the probability distribution of the ratio of the projected separation to the semimajor axis at fixed eccentricity. This expression can be numerically integrated over eccentricity for an arbitrary distribution of eccentricities. I verify my results with empirical comparisons to equivalent but more complex expressions in the literature based on the equations of Keplerian orbits. The closed-formed expressions derived here would be especially useful for any calculation that requires derivatives, e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I also provide a Jupyter notebook including all figures and calculations.",

However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data.

Without a proper naming system, it's like trying to manage a growing library where every book is simply called \"that story about the detective.\" This research matters because it establishes the foundation for organizing and understanding an entirely new category of cosmic objects that could tell us how planetary systems form and evolve.\n\n**What They Did**\n\nThe researchers didn't point telescopes at the sky or crunch observational data. Instead, they tackled a more fundamental challenge: creating a systematic way to name individual exocomets. Think of it like developing the rules for street addresses in a rapidly expanding city. They examined what information we can gather about each exocomet—such as which star it orbits, when it was discovered, and its observable characteristics. Then they designed a naming scheme that would work not just for the handful of exocomets we know today, but for the thousands we expect to discover in the coming decades.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe team successfully developed a comprehensive naming system that can accommodate the unique properties of exocomets while remaining practical for astronomers to use. They demonstrated their system by applying it to several well-studied exocomets, showing how each would receive a distinct identifier. While the paper doesn't provide specific numbers of exocomets catalogued, it represents the first standardized approach to organizing these distant objects, much like how we systematically name hurricanes or catalog asteroids in our own solar system.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nThis naming system arrives at a pivotal moment in exoplanet science. As next-generation telescopes come online, we'll likely discover exocomets by the hundreds or thousands. Having a standardized naming system means astronomers worldwide can communicate clearly about specific objects, track their behavior over time, and build comprehensive databases. This could accelerate our understanding of how comets—which are essentially frozen time capsules from the early solar system—reveal the history and composition of distant planetary systems, potentially bringing us closer to understanding how common Earth-like worlds might be.",
